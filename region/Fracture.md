Between the temperate forests of the [Divine Glorian Empire](DGE) and the savanna grassland where [Maltrossian](Maltross) caravans graze, the spires and towers of [Labyrinthine](Labyrinthine) are first and foremost, but in their shadows lies the torn and ravaged land of Albion's March. Since the political sundering of Central Kingdom of Esh'Dun some four hundred years ago, the marshes and archipelagos surrounding Labyrinthine has been constantly plagued by war and conflict, between dozens nations and states fighting for scarse resources and shelter from the hostile environment.

## Albion's March

The swampy marsh to the south and the cragged islands to the north of Labyrinthine are known throughout history as Albion's March, a name originating from oldtongue with origins buried and lost. Nowadays it is known by many different, sometimes conflicting names - all depending on who you ask. Seventeen or so different geopolitical entities partition these lands into fragmented regions; the borders change daily, and new claims, conquers, and rebellions light up like wildfire.

Even back in the reign of the Forgotten Empire, Albion's March was constantly neglected for its scarsity of natural resources. The swamps are not terrains suitable for either construction or agriculture; While the ocean engulfing the northern islands support oceanic life to some extent, the islands themselves are barely habitable due to stony soil and frequent storms. The Folly of Storm, the wild and unbridled arcane tornado surrounding Labyrinthine, only exacerbated the plight plaguing Albion's March with extreme weathers and mutations in wildlife.

Toward the end of the Tides of Steel, the Divine Glorian Empire was hesitant to annex Albion's March into its borders, so the region united around the gateway city of Bound under the banner of the Central Kingdom of Esh'Dun. This unity proved short-lived, predictably so, when internal conflicts between settlements and cities over resource and land became so irreconcilable that the Kingdom quickly crumbled and fractured into several nation-states warring amongst and within themselves around the turn of the millennium. 

Four centuries after its sundering, the shadows of war never really left Albion's March: despite the departure of many actors of the play, and the arrival of many more that rises to replace their place on stage.
