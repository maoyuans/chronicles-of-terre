When the seas are calm and the skys are clear, those standing on the bleached shores of [Peran](../Peran) can often catch a glimpse of a golden tower, standing out far at sea, guarding the treasures of all of Terre. While such tales by drunken sailors in the tavern might be part exaggeration, the Auric Lighthouse of Selchar is neither myth nor fiction, and stands high and haughty on the island of Selchar, home to the Grand Selchari Vault, the most secure bank and museum all across Terre. Within it locks countless artifacts and treasures, from crown jewels of kingdoms, to cursed swords of demon generals, to ancient spell scrolls of unaccountable origins. Every single item in the Vault has a different story behind it, yet every single one with no exception are worth hoards of treasures, if its value can be reasoned with at all.

Many envies the treasures the Grand Selchari Vault holds, be it thieves on the roads of [Maltross](../Maltross) or academians locked high up within the Clock Tower at [Labyrinthine](../Labyrinthine), yet few dares to trespass into the vault depths. Make no mistake: throughout history many have attempted to challenge the unbreakable vault, and many of these challengers experts of their own craft. Out of all of them, none have succeed. None. Beneath layers upon layers of guards and patrols, locks and mechanisms, glyphs and mazes, those fortunate or skilled enough to delve into the depth all met their end in the hands of a Vault Guardian.

Despite the fame and notority of the Grand Vault, the lower docks of Selchar still houses all the wanna-be's who daydream of wealth and success. Between thieves, pirates, and outlaws, many have to resort to waylaying merchant or traveller ships on their way to store, retrieve, visit, or steal, hoarding wealth, resources, and experience, before making a name for themselves, breaking the unbreakable vault, directing the grandest heist of all time.
