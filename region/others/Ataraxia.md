# Ataraxia, Tavern Between Time

Since the Cataclysm, adventurers around Terre have started to notice strange occurrences happening around them. Out of nowhere, doors, lavish and elaborate, would appear in front of them, or replace what is supposed to be an ordinary entrance or exit. Strange lights and sounds emanate from these slightly ajar gateways, which lead to an unknown realm filled to the brim with fascinating and hypnotizing shapes and patterns, as well as the finest brew found around all of Terre.

It is easy to dismiss these episodes and anecdotes as fever dreams born of boredom or stress or wild imagination. There are however those who have indeed visited **Ataraxia, Tavern Between Time**, and had drinks with the mysterious tavernkeep of draconic ancestry, who refers to herself as **Lady Ataraxia**. From her tavern and base of operation within her own demiplane, Lady Ataraxia watches over the entirety of Terre while hidden from sight, helping those in need and asking for favors in return - or, at least, that is what she claims to do. Her true intentions, just like her true identity, is as always shrouded by mystery.

## Tavern Between Time

Ataraxia seems like a normal tavern at first glance, filled with what you would normally expect - scent of alcohol and faint ambience of joyful celebrations, but with some examination one can easily realize just how deeply mysterious this realm is. While the interior decoration is perhaps just a bit grandeur than an ordinary tavern, if one were to look out of any window on the property, they will be staring into an infinite expanse of voidness, save the occasional flickering starlight drifting within.

Time and space seem to bend and twist haphazardly in Ataraxia. Rooms and buildings occasionally drift past each other in this empty space, yet peering through the windows into the other side might reveal another room just right behind you, or in rare occurrences, yourself from another time.
