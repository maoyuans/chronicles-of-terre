From the beginning of time, the curiosity of humanity have created the zeniths and nadirs of history, and Oscerion the ancient sage witnessed all of them.

## Relationship with Other Deities

Oscerion and [the Elder Wyrm](../patronus/ElderWyrm) are both deities whose creed involves the regulation of magic. Their beliefs are mostly in accord, with Oscerion more focused on guiding the good, and the Elder Wyrm more focused on punishing the evil. Followers of the two deities may disagree on their methods, but share the same goal ultimately.

Both faiths will thus tend to exercise caution with followers of [Arcanum](Arcanum), the god of netheric arcane, and directly oppose the belief of [Paimon](../pars/Paimon), god of forbidden knowledge.
