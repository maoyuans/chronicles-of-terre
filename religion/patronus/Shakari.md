# Shakari

- Demonym: Shakarian 
- Alignment: Neutral Evil
- Domains: Death, **Tyranny**, War
- Titles: The Dunestrider; Great Horned Warrior; Commander of the Sands.
- Holy Symbol: The tail of a scorpion.

The barren outlands to the northeast of the High Wall is a savage and hostile place, to visitors and to residents alike. Outlander tribes fight each other over food, water, and any other resource day and night, and together resorts to raiding and stealing from the other side of the Wall. But even such savagery falls short compared to the great sandstorms of the Barrens, roaming, devouring, and conquering everything caught in its path, feared by even the most fearsome warriors.

Tales are that those who dare venture into the sandstorm will return with treasure and glory, but none have survived to tell such story. The only anecdotes speak of danger, confusion, and the sightings of a shadow towering over the horizon, a mirage of a great horned warrior commanding the storm, and the whispering of her name: Shakari. To this warrior the outlanders pay their fair share of fear and respect, in hope that her relentless savagery can aid them in their journey.

Shakari is mostly depicted as a warrior with a horned helmet, riding on a giant scorpion, although details vary from tribe to tribe. She is the patron goddess of the outlander tribes, sharing the savage ideals with her outlander tribal subjects. Followers of Shakari are mostly of outlander origins, who are savage and cruel, but also surprisingly honorable. While they believe in virtue in strength and will disregard the weak in their pursuit of power, to those stronger they show respect, and to those weaker they show a mercy of some form, though often only due to disinterest and disregard. Some followers of Shakari of Maltrossian origins share similar beliefs, but often more civil and less extreme.

## Relationship with Other Deities

Shakari embodies the fierce savagery of the Barrens, and tend to hold most other deities in hostility. In particular she disdains [Oune](../pars/Oune), goddess of music, and [Prospero](../pars/Prospero), god of commerce and wealth, as these two embodies civility to some extent, a concept Shakari deeply dispises.

Shakari shares some mutual respect with [Strife](../maioris/Strife), god of warfare, for their shared belief that strength is power.
