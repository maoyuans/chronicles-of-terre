# Calendar

The current calendar of Terre is based on the one used by the Forgotten Empire, starting on approximately the date of their ancestor's ascension to Terre through the Shattered Gate, denoted as Ascendant Calendar (AC). The beginning of a year is in fact the summer solstice of Terre - the day when Helios is at its zenith and Fire dominates over the elements.

There are eight months in a single year, in the following order: Yondar, Ertos, Santra, Silour, Vupen, Lylix, Quivea, Helind.

**The current calendar day is Vupen 7th, AC 1412.**

Several festivals and holidays happen on an annual basis, following the Ascendant Calendar. Most holidays are celebrated across all of Terre, due to their shared origin, dating back to imperial days, but some holidays are observed only in specific regions as well.

## The Festival of Fire

Celebrated all across Terre on **Yondar 1st** of each calendar year, the Festival of Fire marks the start of a new year across Terre. The Ascendant Calendar is dated so that the beginning of a new year is summer solstice of Terre, when Elemental Fire is at its prime, so that tieflings can most reliable pierce the veil separating Terre from the Nether during the Ascension.

Each region and culture have different festivities to celebrate the Festival of Fire, but common between all of them is the lighting of fireworks as the calendar date crosses from Helind 30th, the Eve of Fire, to Yondar 1st of the next year. Many regions, including the Divine Glorian Empire, Maltross, and Okeanos, keeps the tradition of ceremonial burning, of paper talismans or wicker-mans, to symbolize the removal of bad fortune or past regrets and mistakes.

## Youalitzli (Carnival of the Night)

A festival celebrated amongst Yharnic tribals and followers of Xbeltz'aloc on **Helind 13th** of each year. The entirety of the jungles of Yharn is enshrouded in a caliginous gloom from dawn to dusk, blocking out even the dim sunlight that manages to penetrate through layers and layers of canopy. The Nocturne Parade is active throughout the entire day, making traversing the jungle extremely dangerous.

The tribes hold ceremonial feasts and conduct ritual sacrifices to appease Xbeltz'aloc, in return for his blessing and protection. In the deep jungles, humanoid sacrifice are still in practice, where unfortunate prisoners and slaves are killed, flayed, or bloodletted as part of the ritual; For those who observe residing in parts of Terre where such gruesome sacrifices are outlawed or impractical, animals are used in place of humanoids.
