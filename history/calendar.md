# Calendar

The current calendar of Terre is based on the one used by the Forgotten Empire, starting on approximately the date of their ancestor's ascension to Terre through the Shattered Gate, denoted as Ascendant Calendar (AC). The beginning of a year is in fact the summer solstice of Terre - the day when Helios is at its zenith and Fire dominates over the elements.

There are eight months in a single year, in the following order: Yondar, Ertos, Santra, Silour, Vupen, Lylix, Quivea, Helind.

**The current calendar day is Helind 13th, AC 1411.**
