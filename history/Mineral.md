# Minerals of Terre

## Types of Metals

**Mundane metals** are non-magical materials that do not possess much characteristics beyond their physical form.

**Innate metals** are generally considered non-magical, but possesses magical-like, or borderline magical natural abilities.

**Magical metals** are minerals infused with latent energy, whose abilities are generally more powerful, but can also be hindered by anti-magical means.

## Traditional Metals

Common mundane metal ores, such as copper, tin, iron, aluminum, exists in Terre, and is fairly common-place. They are widely excavated across the continent, especially in mountainous regions such as Mount Taignos Range and Hollunberg. They adhere to their real-life physical properties such as hardness and malleability, but have no special magical properties. The technology level in Terre as of AC 1412 allows metalsmiths to combine and smelt alloys such as bronze and steel with relative ease.

## Silver

Silver is an uncommon precious mundane metal. It is found in small veins all across Terre, but with slightly higher concentration around central Divine Glorian Empire, around the Crest of Terre.

Silver has slight magical properties tied to warding and abjuration. It is traditionally used to fend off evil and monsters, and as spellcasting materials. Alloys of silver are circulated as currency.

## Gold

Gold is a rare precious mundane metal. It is found in small veins all across Terre. The area of Peran historically had higher concentration of Gold, but it has since been scraped over and over by the Trading Corporation.

Alloys of gold are widely circulated as currency. The Forgotten Empire set alloy recipes for forging gold pieces with a mixture of gold, platinum, tin, and aluminum, worth slightly over 1 gp per piece. Pure gold is hard to extract from the alloy mixture, thus, smelting coin pieces into liquid metal is hard to turn a profit.

## Platinum

Platinum is a rare precious mundane metal. It is found in small veins all across Terre, with no particular concentration discovered.

## Mithral

Mithral is an uncommon mundane metal. It is lightweight and naturally cyan-green in color. It is mostly excavated in plain hills, in particular the Mounds within the borders of Maltross.

Mithral is relatively easy to process, and due to its lightweight properties, can help remedy the otherwise bulky and hindering weight of heavy weaponry or armor. Equipments made with mithral often boosts speed and dexterity in some way.

## Adamantine

Adamantine is a rare mundane metal. It is dull in texture with a dark red-purple color, and hard to break. It is mostly excavated in mountainous regions near the Thyssoloma Range between Divine Glorian Empire and Astartia.

Adamantine has great anti-impact properties, and can endure sudden force without breaking, which makes it an excellent material for both offense and defense. However, adamantine quickly becomes malleable when heat is applied consistently, which enables metalsmiths to work with them even with only primitive technology. Equipments made with adamantine are often associated with critical hit capabilities, or defense against it, in some way.

## Cobalt

Cobalt is a common mundane metal. It has a natural deep blue color, brittle in nature, and is often used in pigments and dyes. It is excavated from mountainous areas across the continent, often found above ground level.

While cobalt is brittle and easily breakable, and unfit for smithing into equipments which are meant to last by itself, it is an expensive yet effective alternative for ammunitions, shattering into deadly shrapnels on impact. Cobalt pieces can also be interlaced onto weapons and armors, boosting their offensive effectiveness at the cost of constantly needing to be resupplied with the metal.

## Palladium

Palladium is an uncommon innate metal. It is bright orange in color with a pinkish-red luster like that of fresh blood. It is excavated beneath lands covered by forests, most notably under Verza and Yharn.

Irrigated by the abundance of life above ground, Palladium contains latent energy that emanates outward, boosting the vitality of creatures around - often reported as a "warm, fuzzy feeling". Equipments made of Palladium does not boast the best physical properties, but can help their wielder recover quickly from injuries and wounds. 

## Orichalcum

Orichalcum is an uncommon mundane metal. It is light metallic brown in color much like copper, but its oxidation exhibits a bright pink pigmentation. It is found underground in Peran and surrounding regions, but also the northern shores of Divine Glorian Empire, between Mount Taignos Range and Albion's March.

Orichalcum's physical properties are close to that of iron's, but it is valued for its exceptional conductivity - so much, that normal artificing prefers copper anyways, since orichalcum conduits tend to be extremely potent and unstable, prone to accidents and discharges. Despite this, orichalcum allows the user to "supercharge" their equipments with electric energy, increasing their potency towards enemies, allies, and the wielder alike.

## Titanium

Titanium is a rare mundane metal. It is dull grey in color much like steel, but darker and not as reflective, and extremely dense and durable. It is mostly found underground in the Hollunberg mountains, and is a common component of advanced dwarven equipment forging. It is a vital ingredient to dwarven ferrite, an alloy of iron, cobalt, and titanium.

Titanium is often compared with adamantine, but unlike its counterpart is durable even under heat, and is thus much harder to smith with. Titanium smithing is a technique only mastered by dwarven experts, who wields this capability with pride. Equipments made with titanium are often bulky and unwieldy, requiring great physical strength to use effectively, but in turn offer great protection.

## Dwarven Ferrite

Dwarven Ferrite is an expensive metal alloy of iron, cobalt, and titanium. It inherits the dull reddish-brown color of raw iron, and rapidly oxidizes when exposed to air, forming a dark, extremely durable protective layer. It takes name from being almost exclusively produced by dwarven smiths of Untergebirgsreich, where the most expensive of its components, titanium, are excavated.

While alloying with iron suppressed titanium's protectiveness, dwarven ferrite's oxidized layer provides alternate protection against hits, and can reform after being destroyed given enough time. Equipments made with dwarven ferrite offers extremely effective protection, but only within limit, and have to recharge before becoming active again. 

## Chlorophyte

Chlorophyte is a rare innate metal. It is lushly verdant green in color, and possesses many properties of living plants, slowly morphing and growing, and shimmers in the light. It is rarely found in small traces in surface-level caves deep within the jungles of Yharn, and are treasured by the tribals and rarely exported outside.

While not inherently magical, chlorophyte's plant-like ability makes it an extremely flexible material to forge equipments with, and valued by druids and practitioners of druidic magic. Depending on the form and process, it can self-repair, morph into different shapes, and even autonomously lash out or defend against enemies, as if with some resemblance of sentience of its own.

## Luminite

Luminite is a common innate metal. It is a rough substance that forms spherical structures naturally, with a dull blue color, and shimmers with dim light at all times. It is found on top of high mountain peaks, forming on rocky surfaces, all across Terre, and in particular in Astartia. It is theorized that the growth of luminite is a result of constant and long-term exposure to moonlight.

Luminite is a somewhat brittle substance and shatters easily, but releases a brilliant flash of light when destroyed. It can be used as consumables or ammunitions to flash, blind, or disorient enemies in emergency situations. When fashioned for permanent use, luminite is usually intended as an exotic light source
