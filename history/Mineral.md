# Minerals of Terre

## Types of Minerals

**Mundane minerals** are non-magical materials that do not possess much characteristics beyond their physical form.

**Innate minerals** are generally considered non-magical, but possesses magical-like, or borderline magical natural abilities.

**Magical minerals** are minerals infused with latent energy, whose abilities are generally more powerful, but can also be hindered by anti-magical means.

## Traditional Metals

Common mundane metal ores, such as copper, tin, iron, aluminum, exists in Terre, and is fairly common-place. They are widely excavated across the continent, especially in mountainous regions such as Mount Taignos Range and Hollunberg. They adhere to their real-life physical properties such as hardness and malleability, but have no special magical properties. The technology level in Terre as of AC 1412 allows metalsmiths to combine and smelt alloys such as bronze and steel with relative ease.

## Silver

Silver is an uncommon precious innate metal. It is found in small veins all across Terre, but with slightly higher concentration around central Divine Glorian Empire, around the Crest of Terre.

Silver has slight magical properties tied to warding and abjuration. It is traditionally used to fend off evil and monsters, and as spellcasting materials. Alloys of silver are circulated as currency.

## Gold

Gold is a rare precious mundane metal. It is found in small veins all across Terre. The area of Peran historically had higher concentration of Gold, but it has since been scraped over and over by the Trading Corporation.

Alloys of gold are widely circulated as currency. The Forgotten Empire set alloy recipes for forging gold pieces with a mixture of gold, platinum, tin, and aluminum, worth slightly over 1 gp per piece. Pure gold is hard to extract from the alloy mixture, thus, smelting coin pieces into liquid metal is hard to turn a profit.

## Platinum

Platinum is a rare precious mundane metal. It is found in small veins all across Terre, with no particular concentration discovered.

## Mithral

Mithral is an uncommon mundane metal. It is lightweight and naturally cyan-green in color. It is mostly excavated in plain hills, in particular the Mounds within the borders of Maltross.

Mithral is relatively easy to process, and due to its lightweight properties, can help remedy the otherwise bulky and hindering weight of heavy weaponry or armor. Equipments made with mithral often boosts speed and dexterity in some way.

## Adamantine

Adamantine is a rare mundane metal. It is dull in texture with a dark red-purple color, and hard to break. It is mostly excavated in mountainous regions near the Thyssoloma Range between Divine Glorian Empire and Astartia.

Adamantine has great anti-impact properties, and can endure sudden force without breaking, which makes it an excellent material for both offense and defense. However, adamantine quickly becomes malleable when heat is applied consistently, which enables metalsmiths to work with them even with only primitive technology. Equipments made with adamantine are often associated with critical hit capabilities, or defense against it, in some way.

## Cobalt

Cobalt is a common mundane metal. It has a natural deep blue color, brittle in nature, and is often used in pigments and dyes. It is excavated from mountainous areas across the continent, often found above ground level.

While cobalt is brittle and easily breakable, and unfit for smithing into equipments which are meant to last by itself, it is an expensive yet effective alternative for ammunitions, shattering into deadly shrapnels on impact. Cobalt pieces can also be interlaced onto weapons and armors, boosting their offensive effectiveness at the cost of constantly needing to be resupplied with the metal.

## Palladium

Palladium is an uncommon innate metal. It is bright orange in color with a pinkish-red luster like that of fresh blood. It is excavated beneath lands covered by forests, most notably under Verza and Yharn.

Irrigated by the abundance of life above ground, Palladium contains latent energy that emanates outward, boosting the vitality of creatures around - often reported as a "warm, fuzzy feeling". Equipments made of Palladium does not boast the best physical properties, but can help their wielder recover quickly from injuries and wounds. 

## Orichalcum

Orichalcum is an uncommon mundane metal. It is light metallic brown in color much like copper, but its oxidation exhibits a bright pink pigmentation. It is found underground in Peran and surrounding regions, but also the northern shores of Divine Glorian Empire, between Mount Taignos Range and Albion's March.

Orichalcum's physical properties are close to that of iron's, but it is valued for its exceptional conductivity - so much, that normal artificing prefers copper anyways, since orichalcum conduits tend to be extremely potent and unstable, prone to accidents and discharges. Despite this, orichalcum allows the user to "supercharge" their equipments with electric energy, increasing their potency towards enemies, allies, and the wielder alike.

## Titanium

Titanium is a rare mundane metal. It is dull grey in color much like steel, but darker and not as reflective, and extremely dense and durable. It is mostly found underground in the Hollunberg mountains, and is a common component of advanced dwarven equipment forging. It is a vital ingredient to dwarven ferrite, an alloy of iron, cobalt, and titanium.

Titanium is often compared with adamantine, but unlike its counterpart is durable even under heat, and is thus much harder to smith with. Titanium smithing is a technique only mastered by dwarven experts, who wields this capability with pride. Equipments made with titanium are often bulky and unwieldy, requiring great physical strength to use effectively, but in turn offer great protection.

## Dwarven Ferrite

Dwarven Ferrite is an expensive metal alloy of iron, cobalt, and titanium. It inherits the dull reddish-brown color of raw iron, and rapidly oxidizes when exposed to air, forming a dark, extremely durable protective layer. It takes name from being almost exclusively produced by dwarven smiths of Untergebirgsreich, where the most expensive of its components, titanium, are excavated.

While alloying with iron suppressed titanium's protectiveness, dwarven ferrite's oxidized layer provides alternate protection against hits, and can reform after being destroyed given enough time. Equipments made with dwarven ferrite offers extremely effective protection, but only within limit, and have to recharge before becoming active again. 

## Chlorophyte

Chlorophyte is a rare innate metal. It is lushly verdant green in color, and possesses many properties of living plants, slowly morphing and growing, and shimmers in the light. It is rarely found in small traces in surface-level caves deep within the jungles of Yharn, and are treasured by the tribals and rarely exported outside.

While not inherently magical, chlorophyte's plant-like ability makes it an extremely flexible material to forge equipments with, and valued by druids and practitioners of druidic magic. Depending on the form and process, it can self-repair, morph into different shapes, and even autonomously lash out or defend against enemies, as if with some resemblance of sentience of its own.

## Luminite

Luminite is a common innate crystal. It is a rough substance that forms spherical structures naturally, with a dull blue color, and shimmers with dim light at all times. It is found on top of high mountain peaks, forming on rocky surfaces, all across Terre, and in particular in Astartia. It is theorized that the growth of luminite is a result of constant and long-term exposure to moonlight.

Luminite is a somewhat brittle substance and shatters easily, but releases a brilliant flash of light when destroyed. It can be used as consumables or ammunitions to flash, blind, or disorient enemies in emergency situations. When fashioned for permanent use, luminite is usually intended as an exotic light source

## Bismuth

Bismuth is a rare magical metal. It is chromatic metal with crystalline structures forming in shapes of cubes, with colors constantly changing depending on the angle of refraction. Bismuth outcrops are found exclusively in regions with prolonged exposure to arcane magic, such as Albion's March and Okeanos. Bismuth has been excavated in regions around Shattered Gate, but the Verzae Legion has outlawed usage of Bismuth.

Bismuth is infused with heavy elemental magic and rather unstable in its raw form, often lashing out its energy into the surroundings. When processed and alloyed with mundane substances, Bismuth can act as catalysts for arcane casting, amplifying the power of all elementals at the same time, and is as thus highly sought after by spellcasters of Labyrinthine and Okeanos. Bismuth is the Provincial Empire's sole import, through strict trade treatises with the Labyrinthine Mages' Guild.

## Cryonic

Cryonic is an uncommon magical crystal that is infused with elemental ice and water energy. In isolation, Cryonic is a deep blue-purple rock crystal substance, but when exposed to ambient mana in the air, quickly forms light blue crystalline spikes growing from the node. Cryonic is mostly excavated beneath mountains in cold environments, most notably in Mount Taignos Range bordering Divine Glorian Empire and Okeanos, as rough crystal nodules embedded in rock. Handling Cryonic requires special precautions, since prolonged exposure can quickly drain heat and cause hypothermia.

Cryonic is not a very sturdy substance and is reactive and brittle, but can be alloyed with other sturdy metals to infuse them with elemental ice magic. Apart from acting as a conduit and catalyst for ice magic, cryonic alloys can also concentrate atmospheric mana into crystals for harvesting or other uses.

## Scoria

Scoria is an uncommon magical metal that is infused with elemental fire energy. It is a dark rocky substance similar in texture to basalt, obsidian, and other lava rocks, with veins of molten magma embedded in them. Scoria is excavated deep underground in areas with heavy lava activity, most prominently under Untergebirgsreich in the Hollunberg mountains. Raw Scoria nodules is warm to the touch, and often blends in with the mundane lava rocks in the environment, but breaking open the nodule can cause bursts of flame and lava from within, and thus must be handled and processed with care.

When processed, Scoria alloys are quite sturdy and resistant, and are often infused into martial weapons and armors, adding heat to the usual destructiveness of armaments. On the other hand, raw scoria is more practical to work with for spellcasters, who can better control and utilize the latent energy within the ore to their benefit.

## Perennia

Perennia is a rare magical metal, often associated with poison, death, and decay. Similar to chlorophyte, Perennia possesses many plant-like characteristics, taking on a dull brown appearance like dead wood. Curiously, patches of dark green coloration similar to damp moss will appear occasionally on pure perennia ore, alternating between mossed and unmossed states with a cycle of roughly four and a half years. Perennia is found in small and sparse patches buried shallowly underground near the surface, often adjacent to ancient mass burials and graves.

Mossed and unmossed perennia possesses slightly different magical properties, but is overall associated with destructive poisonous and necrotic properties, unlike chlorophyte or palladium. Equipments made of perennia can debilitate enemies with curse-like and debuffing statuses, but must be crafted with care, since a shift in the state of its material might cause unintended effects.

## Uelivium

Uelivium is an uncommon magical metal that is infused with elemental earth energy. Raw and processed uelivium are both dull in color not unlike dirt, but is much sturdier and heavier, and tend to vibrate and quake very slightly. Uelivium is excavated as small patch of clustered nodules embedded in dirt underground near the surface, around the mountainous regions bordering Peran, Divine Glorian Empire, and Yharn. While uelivium nodules are almost harmless in isolation, sizable clusters can often vibrate in synchronization when disturbed to produce localized earthquakes, causing cave-ins and other hazards.

Uelivium is most commonly smelted into materials for heavy armor and armaments, that can channel the might of the elemental earth both offensively and defensively. Consequently, it is very unwieldy in large amount for spellcasters and people who prefer lightweight equipment, unless made into expensive alloys.

## Gausstone

Gausstone is an uncommon magical metal that is infused with elemental lightning and air energy. With appearances much like unoxidized copper in both its raw and processed form, gausstone possesses additional static electricity that courses and zips through its surface like small bolts of bright yellow lightning. Gausstone builds up static charge, which can discharge on contact, either as a harmless zap or a powerful shock depending on the buildup magnitude; handling of gausstone is thus dangerous, and proper equipments such as rubber gloves and other forms of insulation is required. Gausstone is mostly found in regions with frequent storms in coastal areas, such as around the Clearwater Gulf or the outer islands of Albion's March.

Gausstone is valued for it's lightning affinity by spellcasters, but its innate electricity buildup is also valuable to use for armors and armaments. Equipments forged with gausstone can store these electric energies and lash out at enemies at the appropriate time.

## Hallowed Silver

Hallowed silver is a rare magical metal with holy, divine properties and associated with radiant damage. Hallowed silver shares many physical properties with normal silver, as a colorless metallic substance, with a slight golden hue and a dimly shimmering aura. It is said that those impure of heart will feel a deep sense of guilt when approaching hallowed silver ores and veins. Most of the hallowed silver deposits on Terre are located within the Crest of Terre, and controlled by the Church of Gloria within the Divine Glorian Empire.

Inquisitors and priests of the Church of Gloria values hallowed silver for their holy properties, and equipments forged from hallowed silver are extra effective against evil beings and outsiders such as fiends and undeads.
