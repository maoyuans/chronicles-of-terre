# The Selchari Heist

*Old mate,*

*Here's a proposal for you. A heist, the grandest of all time, for all the fortune and glory. A Selchari heist.*

*Now I know what you're thinking. "This crazy old man comes with another crazy old plan." Yes, I don't blame you, we all know that none have broken into the Grand Selchari, the unbreakable vault. Even the lucky few to get pass all the security into the vault proper dies by the Guardian. Why should we risk our lives on a suicide mission?*

*But hear me out one last time. You few are the best rogues I've ever got, and this one is the best opportunity in ages. I can't go into details, in case this letter falls into the wrong hands, but with your expertise and my schemes, this heist might just work out.*

*Think of your aspirations all those years ago. Your aspirations that invites you to this wretched island, to these depraved docks, to my humble crew. We've done enough jobs to feed our families and retire to the countryside, but have we really done it if there isn't a score on the Grand Selchari?*

*Think about it well. You know where to find me. I look forward to our reunion. For all the fortune and glory, let us do this one last job.*

* * *
