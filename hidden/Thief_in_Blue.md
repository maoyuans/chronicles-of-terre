# Thief in Blue

Romani Vento sits behind his luxurious rich mahogany desk, tapping his fingers on it impatiently. His takes out his pocket watch and reads the time. *Three to midnight*, it reads.

When is the last time he had waited for someone? No one makes Don Rom wait, not on his turf. He controls Block Eighteen of Barohaven, and everyone here, from beggars, smugglers, merchants, to enforcers, operate under his mercy. Ever since he took over the family from his father's hands, his name has been held in the utmost respect. Punctuality is one of the most fundamental respects he deserves.

Rom has held himself to this standard as much as he could, to those who deserves his time and respect, such as his children, old friends, or representatives from other families and syndicates. At time he will make others wait outside of his door, sometimes for hours at once - a technique to assert his authority over them, for a upper-hand in negotiations. But the poor souls have no choice in this matter - they usually know quite well what awaits them if there's the slightest amount of dissent and impatience, and the few of those who don't are made quick examples for future visitors.

He expects no less from his unexpected visitor tonight.

And it is now three - he takes out the watch again - no, two minutes from their announced time of arrival. Yet, no news has reach him about his guest's whereabouts quite yet. This makes him anxious.

Letting out a long sigh, Rom takes out a cigar from the desk drawers. With a simple wave of the hand, he calls forward his assistant by the side, who quickly lights up the cigar for him. The hands of the old mafia, shiveled by age and time, trembles a bit, before sending the lit cigar into his mouth.

"Maybe she's on her way right now! It's not quite midnight yet, is it?" The assistant suggests. It is perhaps out of a good heart that she is trying to comfort him, but Rom would have scolded her for the frivolous tone and lack of respect in her words. Alas, he'll let it slip this one time. His mind is not on such trivial formalities.

The Don takes a deep puff of his cigar, and slowly exhales the smoke out. Fragrance made from the best leaves from plantations in the Divine Empire supplying the imperial family, mixed with strokes of flavor of Olivian spices from Okeanos, this is the one indulgence he can find some serenity in even in such stressful times.

But... He still finds the situation absurd, no matter how much tobacco is in effect to soothe his mind. Rom looks down towards the letter open on his desk, written in clean and elegant cursive in <span style="color:#CFE2F3">blue ink</span>, addressed to him, and frowns. One question resonates within his wizened mind.

What kind of thief in their right mind would send a letter to the Don Rom, announcing their visit to **steal** his treasure?

---

The letter is signed by <span style="color:#CFE2F3">*Thief in Blue*</span>. Rom has heard of the title in passing before - They have stolen from many other families in Barohaven or Peran at large before, friends and rivals alike. Trustworthy information, aside from tall tales and myths among the destitute, are scarse, however, as even his old friends are reluctant to discuss the encounter at length.

There is little doubt in his mind that this Thief in Blue is quite able. Taking on the many families amongst the streets of Barohaven is no small feat. Nonetheless, the Don is still somewhat confident to play defense: This hideout is his playground, and those who come to him will have to play the game on his terms. As long as he can hold onto the Thief's mark with a steady hand...

But why would they want to take this no-good macuahuitl...? Rom looks toward the display case under the only spotlight, where the obsidian tribal blade sits quietly and unassumingly within. His goons taxed it out of a passing tribesman hailing from the jungles of Yharn, seeing that it's the only thing of remotely any value on him. He had associated mages and smiths check on it after receiving the letter - there is neither traces of magic, nor excellent craftsmenship to support any significant value; He only put it on display for this special occasion, or else it would be left forgotten in one of the many storerooms within the estate.

He picks up the letter, adjusts his monocle, and quickly skims through the letter once more. Perhaps there's more to their motives? Perhaps the letter is just a hoax, either to make him afraid, or to distract him from some other treasure that they want? <span style="color:#CFE2F3">No, they wouldn't eat their word...</span> Perhaps-

His thoughts are interrupted. The clock strikes twelve - two minutes pass by fast when one's deep in thought. It is the scheduled time, yet the guest is nowhere to be found still. <span style="color:#CFE2F3">Why hasn't they arrived?</span>

"Come, kid." The old Don rises, either in frustration or anticipation, and extends a hand towards the assistant to take over his fedora. "If our guest refuses to see us, we shall go forth meet them."

"Yes, of course!" His assistant chuckles.

To which he frowns. "Eloisa, you should cull your-"

**Something is not right.** Rom picks up his fedora again to take a look - it is not his black velvet hat. Instead, he's holding a pointed cap painted in <span style="color:#CFE2F3">blue</span>.

"What's wrong, dear? Cat's got your tongue?" The lady behind him giggles some more, and circles into his view. Rom slowly raises up his head, and is greeted by the distant <span style="color:#CFE2F3">yet familiar</span> smiles of a gnome woman. He blinks a few time in disbelief: When did she- How did she- Where is Eloisa, then- <span style="color:#CFE2F3">Or is she Eloisa to begin with?</span>

"Oh, don't be so shy! We're no strangers to each other, right?" She pulls out the armchair across the desk, meant for the most esteemed guests with the honor to sit with the Don, and hops on it casually, sitting on top of its back as opposed to in it, bringing her up to his height. "Just call me Blue. I don't mind."

A brief moment of fear sweeps across his mind. "Come! Get this crazy woman out of here!" Rom raises his voice, shouting towards the door. A long, dreadful silence follows.

"Bah, don't worry about your henchmen barging into your meeting." Blue chuckles lightly, with a hand covering her mouth. "Their shift ends at midnight, aint it? Darling, you should know this better than I do!"

"But the next shift - they will be here any minute-"

"Shhhh..." She leans in, "You forgot, didn't you? Hehe, you always do, old man. You're having a special meeting tonight with the most esteemed guest, and you don't wany anyone disturbing you, right?"

...Did he? Rom pauses and thinks back to his orders earlier. Vague fragments of recollection and memory slowly slip back into his memory - <span style="color:#CFE2F3">Yes, maybe he did, that will explain it</span>... But why?
