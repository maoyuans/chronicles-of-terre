# Heist Plan

We need to plan a heist. But how?

What's in the Grand Selchari Vault:
- The entrance and passageways within the vault is heavily guarded by soldiers and constructs.
- The Vault Guardian, a towering construct protecting the entrance to the Vault proper. Fortified by a layer of voidsteel, it nullifies all hostile magical effects, rendering it nearly invulnerable.
- Bleach Moon, a magical orb that washes artificial moonlight within the chamber of the Vault Guardian, dispelling almost all magical effects and shapeshifting. 
- A maze that is the Vault proper itself, magically obfuscated with looping corridors, false entrances and exits, and portal doors that constantly change their destinations. To reach a specific item without guidance is nigh impossible.
- A layer of conceptual identity verification protecting individual items, which will only unlock if provided with proof that the client is indeed the owner or appointed by the owner; or that the retriever is a Curator of the Vault.



How do we overwhelm the defenses the Vault:
- Within the Fracture, the canyon fault caused by a construction accident within the Vault, are entrances to a cavern system that can reach somewhere close to the empty space below the Vault Guardian chamber. Breaching the reinforced cave walls is difficult but possible.
- For the Vault Guardian, a secret key can grant access to the control panel, used exclusively for maintenance purposes. The control panel can test basic functions of the Guardian, most notably capable of disabling communications, and exposing the processing core of the Guardian, which is vulnerable to attacks. The secret key is held in two halves, one by the Curators of the Vault, one by the Perani Trading Corporation, and must be united to have any effect.
- For the Vault Guardian, one can breach the voidsteel coating and expose the core alternatively by weapons with high enough physical impact, for example some of the most technologically advanced firearms by Perani gunsmiths. 
- For the Vault proper maze, a minotaur can make easy work of the maze, being magical creatures gifted with the talent and curse of pathfinding.
- For the conceptual identity verification, either steal from one of the curators, or after some time Kyokutei will provide a vial of blood of unknown origin.
