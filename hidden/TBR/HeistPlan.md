# Heist Plan

## Defenses of the Grand Vault

- The above-ground halls. Guards regularly patrol the area, and the doors are locked during after-hours.
- An elevator connecting the main halls to the underground sections. The elevator only activates with special keycards held by authorized personnels, and usually guarded by an operator.
- The underground passageways leading to the vault proper. There is a manned checkpoint at the exit of the elevator, checking the credentials of vault staffs and screening visitors for any potential weapons. The passageway themselves are straight and narrow, and monitored by scrying eyes that see through even invisibility.
- The Guardian chamber. An empty cavern-chamber with a platform above a bottomless pit, overseen by an enormous construct known as the "Vault Guardian", and its control room on an overhang on the opposite side. The Guardian itself is autonomous to some degree, using electricity and blunt force to repel any unwanted intrusions, and is protected by a thick shell of titanium alloy, that is extremely durable and resistant. The chamber is also equipped with a quartz crystal, the "Glass Moon", that can reveal shapeshifters, invisibility, and dispel magic periodically.
- The labyrinth. A system of corridors that connects the entrance guarded by the Vault Guardian to individual chambers housing the vault's treasures, that is constantly shifting and changing, and almost impossible to directly navigate. Vault staffs are provided with an enigmatic cipher tablet that reverse-engineers the labyrinth's shifts and gives real-time directions to navigate towards the desired destination.
- The identity verification. As a final and most impenetrable layer of defense, a barrier of force within each vault chamber protects the storage case itself. Designed and cast by Labyrinthine high mages, this barrier is normally dormant, but once bound to an owner and activated can only be disarmed by its owner or their designated proxy, verifying their identity on a conceptual level, to prevent unauthorized access from within or without the vault.
- A final lock. The complex but mundane mechanical lock on the storage case that is opened by a matching titanium key, given to the owner upon confirmation of storage.

## To Plan a Heist

### Route A: The Brute-Force
Infiltrate the ranks of the guards of the Grand Vault, either as an actual employee, or via disguise and sleights of hands. Guards stationed in the underground portions of the Grand Vault are exchanged thrice a day, which can allow the party to slip through most of security above ground and in the elevator. Requires convincing forged documents to get pass the underground checkpoint, and other brute-forces to break out of the security corridor. The Guardian chamber and beyond are unmanned, and must be navigated via other methods.

### Route B: The Watery Grave
Explore the coastal cliffs of Selchar, the "Fracture" that a construction accident from deep within the Vault caused, and find a way through the danger and darkness of an underground cavern system, fighting wildlife as well as sirenkin. The tunnels lead to the bottom of the pit of the Guardian chamber, but was reinforced by a think layer of titanium; a demolition specialist needs to be recruited, and the Guardian chamber and beyond must be solved via other methods.

### Route C: The Maintenance Crew
Catch the opportunity as the semiannual Perani inspection delegation arrives at the Grand Vault. The newly appointed inspector general has not been to the island yet, so it is possible to deceive both parties with careful human resource management. With luck, this plan can give a clear passage towards the exposed core of the Vault Guardian, but the labyrinth and the verification must be solved also.

### The Vault Guardian
- The Guardian's shell is reinforced by magic - help the local gunsmith finish his secret weapon voidsteel rifle, by rescuing him from home arrest, and fetching the materials withheld by the custom. Breaching the shell allows the Guardian to be fought and disabled.
- Through disguises and careful identity theft, one can pass as the inspector general from Peran to disable the Guardian's outer shell for maintenance, which exposes its core for forced disabling.

### The Labyrinth
- The cipher tablets used by vault staffs can be stolen, but will appear as scrambled text unless properly deciphered with linguistics.
- Lady Ataraxia can provide a master cipher only held by Clock Tower lords, that completely bypasses the labyrinth by altering the walls and mechanisms directly.
- A minotaur navigator with a natural sense of direction within mazes can be recruited eventually to help them clear a path.

### The Identity Verification
- Kyokutei will eventually provide the party a blood vial rumored to be filled with Miyatsuki's blood.
- A pendant the party finds will turn out to be Miyatsuki's relic; the party can learn of the relic's true name and use his voice to bypass the barrier.

We need to plan a heist. But how?

What's in the Grand Selchari Vault:
- The entrance and passageways within the vault is heavily guarded by soldiers and constructs.
- The Vault Guardian, a towering construct protecting the entrance to the Vault proper. Fortified by a layer of voidsteel, it nullifies all hostile magical effects, rendering it nearly invulnerable.
- Bleach Moon, a magical orb that washes artificial moonlight within the chamber of the Vault Guardian, dispelling almost all magical effects and shapeshifting. 
- A maze that is the Vault proper itself, magically obfuscated with looping corridors, false entrances and exits, and portal doors that constantly change their destinations. To reach a specific item without guidance is nigh impossible.
- A layer of conceptual identity verification protecting individual items, which will only unlock if provided with proof that the client is indeed the owner or appointed by the owner; or that the retriever is a Curator of the Vault.



How do we overwhelm the defenses the Vault:
- Within the Fracture, the canyon fault caused by a construction accident within the Vault, are entrances to a cavern system that can reach somewhere close to the empty space below the Vault Guardian chamber. Breaching the reinforced cave walls is difficult but possible.
- For the Vault Guardian, a secret key can grant access to the control panel, used exclusively for maintenance purposes. The control panel can test basic functions of the Guardian, most notably capable of disabling communications, and exposing the processing core of the Guardian, which is vulnerable to attacks. The secret key is held in two halves, one by the Curators of the Vault, one by the Perani Trading Corporation, and must be united to have any effect.
- For the Vault Guardian, one can breach the voidsteel coating and expose the core alternatively by weapons with high enough physical impact, for example some of the most technologically advanced firearms by Perani gunsmiths. 
- For the Vault proper maze, a minotaur can make easy work of the maze, being magical creatures gifted with the talent and curse of pathfinding.
- For the conceptual identity verification, either steal from one of the curators, or after some time Kyokutei will provide a vial of blood of unknown origin.
