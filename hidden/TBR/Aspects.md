# Cosmic Aspects

Chronicle of Terre's cosmology is very different from that of the Forgotten Realms. Most notably, there are very few planes, and interdimensional travel methods are scarse. Most of Chronicle of Terre's story take place in the Material plane (the continent of Terre), the Nether plane, and the Dream realm.

The universe in Chronicles of Terre, known as the Cosmos, is a hyperdimensional space that most cannot fathom. The Cosmos is inhabited by various immortal, omniscient entities known as 'aspects', each representing a different facet of existence.

These Aspects manifest in the planes of Terre as projections of themselves from the Cosmos' higher dimension. This allows mortal creatures to perceive, interpret, and interact with the Aspects, and their existence to be translated to philosophies.

## List of Cosmic Aspects

- Myriad 万象: Omnipresent self. The incomprehensible transposition of one towards everything in existence, understanding and experiencing all perspectives simultaneously.
- The Void 太虚: Unison in oblivion. The nihilistic decline of the universe towards nothingness, the convergence point of all changes. Only in this singularity can we find unity.
- Apotheosis 登峰: Perfected meridian. Perfection is the destiny of all things, the flawed are irrelevant, and one defect shall nullify all virtues.
- Plethora 多裕: Power of many. Collaboration is vital to survival; It is only through collective effort that the meek shall overcome the mighty. 
- Solipsis 唯识: Power of one. To whittle away beliefs about which one cannot be certain, one will eventually recognize the existence of the self as the singular certainty. 
- Gnosis 灵知: Inquisitive sobriety. The most noble merit in the pursuit of absolute knowledge is to remain clear headed, not allowing oneself to become swayed by the falsehood of madness and morality. 
- Kvell 伏臣: Rejoice in vulnerability. Take pride in the accomplishment of others, and accept your role as a side character. Experience life from the low point so that you may appreciate the highs better. 
- Baphomet 律反: Grim contrarian. In order to gain insight, you must first accept that you have none. The mortal mind is restrained by its capacity, so it is foolish to believe your thoughts will ever be fully informed. 
- Dynasty 纪代: Triumphant authority. Understand the importance of harmony and stability, even if the conditions are not ideal. There is still more life to live after the hardship is endured. 
- Nostalgia 追昔: Crystallized remembrance. Lay your ambitions to rest knowing that the moment has passed you by. Remembers the teachings of history, lest past glory be replaced by inferior imitations. 
- Babel 巴别: Shared design. Ask a thousand men, and you shall receive a thousand answers. Let a thousand men talk amongst themselves, then you may find consensus, or the acknowledgement of a lack thereof - in either case, unity. 
- Pandemonium 大混沌: Cycle breaker. It is easy to look back and think that you are destined to walk the path you walk. Venture, explore, and have confidence that your will is your own. 
- Author 创作: Engine of stories. Those who write have keen eyes for captivating schemes that can advance the plot. Tradition and morality are irrelevant, the cosmos appreciate a good villian in their story. 
- Ouroboros 食尾蛇: Perpetual motion. Seasons grow and fade, at once the same, yet ever-flowing forward. Change is the only constant across the vast dimensions of the cosmos.
