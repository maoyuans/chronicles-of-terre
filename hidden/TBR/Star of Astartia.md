# Miyatsuki

Miyatsuki Katsuhiro, current lord (14th). 
- Gifted child, have heavy expectations put onto him to replicate Otoeda. Currently burnt out and paranoid, but seemingly close to his goal.
- Prideful, cruel, and selfish. Not a good leader, but a good lord.
- Understands his goal as re-conquering Astartia and maybe the entire world. Has an army ready, but missing a decisive advantage.
- Needs the Star of Astartia to proclaim himself a lord worthy to succeed Otoeda, and envies the power rumored to be held within.
- Wants the party to steal the Star, knowing that he won't be able to retrieve it himself, and to be clean without blood on his hands. Doesn't quite care about them, since the party have to take on it anyways.
- Plans to just capture and imprison the party once they return the Star, unless they are really good little helpers.

Miyatsuki Otoeda, Demon King (11th)
- Bastard child of 10th lord Miyatsuki and siren Utako. Father abandoned his mother and him. Revolted against father to claim lordship and vengeance. Half-siren, with charm powers, led his army to conquer Astartia, hailed as the "Demon King".
- Passed away soon after emperorship, throne returned. Reached out by Apotheosis post-mortem to be ordained harbinger, but rejected and returned as Kyokutei.
- Honor-bound samurai, and mostly a kind old man. 
- Dying wish is to let her siren mother's voice sing across the land again -> conquer. As Kyokutei, want to assist Katsuhiro in acquiring the Star.
- Star of Astartia is his father's gift to mother, and contains her voice. Whoever wears it has a part of that power. It is a very personal heirloom.
- Party...?
- Plan after...?

# Selchar

## Local Gangs

### Old Crew

An experienced heist crew that has broken many banks in Peran, and came out of retirement to take advantage of a rumored lapse in defense of the Grand Selchari. They were set up by "Black Breath", and were all caught except for one.

Members are: Lucky, a stealth expert who seems to have luck on his side, at the expense of that of his friends; Boss, the mastermind and the planner; Vinderi, demolition guy who's high on fumes all the time; Ginseng, master of disguises; Gossmer, retired Peran engineer and hacker.

Lucky was able to escape the setup. He would help the party, in hopes of breaking the Grand Selchari to prove a point, and to defeat Black Breath for betrayal.

### Water Cartel

Led by "Father" Micali, Italian mafia gang. Branch of the cartel operating in Peran, deals with mostly potions, and shipwrecks, but also other kinds of goods. The intended route and ally. Holds themselves as a high-class gang, although most mobs are sailors. Good relations with the Jewellers.

Operates in a cove under the cliffs, near the entrance to the Fracture. Requires a lot of exploring to reach on their own - or save a stupid sailor on the beach. Father Micali is a tiefling water genasi, can help party with water-breathing stuffs.

Quests:
- Micali's stupid son went missing. He gets caught by Henchmen. Want to run away from Father because he doesn't like gang boss duties.
- Sirens are patrolling near a shipwreck that the Cartel wants to salvage.
- Crates with valuable stuffs floated into Driftwood, need to compete with the Dredgers to recover them.

### Jewelers

Led by "Yoru", a secretive society of craftsmen. Most members run legitimate storefronts in Upper Selchar. Deals with art pieces, jewelries, and antiques. Experts in forgeries. Don't exactly consider themselves a "gang" gang, more a crafter's guild or something, but underground. Good relations with the Water Cartel. Yoru is a sapphire dragonborn operating the bathhouse.

Operates in shops around Upper Selchar, as well as into the sewers there. Uncovering the existence of an underground society might be hard - maybe a web between merchants, etc. Some opportunity to save a merchant's life would be nice.

Gixustraut the gunsmith knows the Jewelers but doesn't contact with them. 

Quests:
- Some official is trying to extort a jewel smith and/or get very expensive taxes going on. Either convince or threaten them?
- Lowtown raiders have ransacked one of the shops on the outer rim of Upper Selchar.
- Something about the bathhouse idk idk idk

### Lowtown Raiders

Led by Crazy Cassie (gnome), outback biker gang? Raiders are wild and chaotic, and follows their instincts, running the streets of Lowtown. Deals with common wares, but also weapons and especially guns. Loosely organized but follows the order of Crazy Cassie because she's so fucking cool. Kinda allied with Dredgers and enemies with Jewelers.

Main base is a scrapyard on the north beach. Raiders are very overt and aren't afraid to make themselves known loud and clear. Chaotic but also easy to make friends with if you can match their freak. Doesn't like wealthy people.

Gixustraut was chilling with them since they like his guns. Maybe house arrest arc, idk.

Quests:
- Some pirates seized a motorboat of theirs, idk. Go get that back.
- Go steal or just rob some merchant craftsmen of the Jewelers for rare parts to make a big fucking gun.

### Dredgers of Driftwood

Led by Rusthook, ex-pirate scavengers. Pirates who got kicked off their crew, who shipwrecked, etc, and built driftwood town with scraps and wreckages. Deals with... random oddities? Basically runs driftwood and fighting with Selchari officials who want to get rid of the place. Doesn't like the Jewelers for being high-class assholes and the Water Cartel for also being high-class assholes and stealing their loots.

Entire driftwood town is their place, town hall is the hull of Rusthook's old ship. They really don't fight for much of a purpose other than their own survival...? And also normal pirate shenanigans.

Vinderi broke out of prison and they are sheltering him somewhere... in a siren's cove.

Quests:
- Guards are being problematic.
- Sirens are being problematic.
- Pirates are being problematic.

### Black Breath's Henchmen

Led by "Black Breath", a black dragonborn and newcomer to Selchar. In just two years of arrival he has already made a name for himself as a ruthless tyrant, and many bandits and cutthroats have converged under his banner.

Have established bases all around Selchar - often times encroaching the space of other gangs. Main base is hidden in a tavern called "Bad Barrel". Need to find clues on where it is.

Black Breath is a member of the Acolyte of the Harbingers, a cult to the Corruption. There are cultists leading the bandits of his gang. He has also betrayed the Old Crew before, making him a personal target for Lucky.

# Heist Plan

## Defenses of the Grand Vault

- The above-ground halls. Guards regularly patrol the area, and the doors are locked during after-hours.
- An elevator connecting the main halls to the underground sections. The elevator only activates with special keycards held by authorized personnels, and usually guarded by an operator.
- The underground passageways leading to the vault proper. There is a manned checkpoint at the exit of the elevator, checking the credentials of vault staffs and screening visitors for any potential weapons. The passageway themselves are straight and narrow, and monitored by scrying eyes that see through even invisibility.
- The Guardian chamber. An empty cavern-chamber with a platform above a bottomless pit, overseen by an enormous construct known as the "Vault Guardian", and its control room on an overhang on the opposite side. The Guardian itself is autonomous to some degree, using electricity and blunt force to repel any unwanted intrusions, and is protected by a thick shell of titanium alloy, that is extremely durable and resistant. The chamber is also equipped with a quartz crystal, the "Glass Moon", that can reveal shapeshifters, invisibility, and dispel magic periodically.
- The labyrinth. A system of corridors that connects the entrance guarded by the Vault Guardian to individual chambers housing the vault's treasures, that is constantly shifting and changing, and almost impossible to directly navigate. Vault staffs are provided with an enigmatic cipher tablet that reverse-engineers the labyrinth's shifts and gives real-time directions to navigate towards the desired destination.
- The identity verification. As a final and most impenetrable layer of defense, a barrier of force within each vault chamber protects the storage case itself. Designed and cast by Labyrinthine high mages, this barrier is normally dormant, but once bound to an owner and activated can only be disarmed by its owner or their designated proxy, verifying their identity on a conceptual level, to prevent unauthorized access from within or without the vault.
- A final lock. The complex but mundane mechanical lock on the storage case that is opened by a matching titanium key, given to the owner upon confirmation of storage.

## To Plan a Heist

### Route A: The Brute-Force
Infiltrate the ranks of the guards of the Grand Vault, either as an actual employee, or via disguise and sleights of hands. Guards stationed in the underground portions of the Grand Vault are exchanged thrice a day, which can allow the party to slip through most of security above ground and in the elevator. Requires convincing forged documents to get pass the underground checkpoint, and other brute-forces to break out of the security corridor. The Guardian chamber and beyond are unmanned, and must be navigated via other methods.

### Route B: The Watery Grave
Explore the coastal cliffs of Selchar, the "Fracture" that a construction accident from deep within the Vault caused, and find a way through the danger and darkness of an underground cavern system, fighting wildlife as well as sirenkin. The tunnels lead to the bottom of the pit of the Guardian chamber, but was reinforced by a think layer of titanium; a demolition specialist needs to be recruited, and the Guardian chamber and beyond must be solved via other methods.

### Route C: The Maintenance Crew
Catch the opportunity as the semiannual Perani inspection delegation arrives at the Grand Vault. The newly appointed inspector general has not been to the island yet, so it is possible to deceive both parties with careful human resource management. With luck, this plan can give a clear passage towards the exposed core of the Vault Guardian, but the labyrinth and the verification must be solved also.

### The Vault Guardian
- The Guardian's shell is reinforced by magic - help the local gunsmith finish his secret weapon voidsteel rifle, by rescuing him from home arrest, and fetching the materials withheld by the custom. Breaching the shell allows the Guardian to be fought and disabled. (Jewelers or Raiders?)
- Through disguises and careful identity theft, one can pass as the inspector general from Peran to disable the Guardian's outer shell for maintenance, which exposes its core for forced disabling. (Jewelers)

### The Labyrinth
- The cipher tablets used by vault staffs can be stolen, but will appear as scrambled text unless properly deciphered with linguistics. (Jewelers or Cartel)
- Lady Ataraxia can provide a master cipher only held by Clock Tower lords, that completely bypasses the labyrinth by altering the walls and mechanisms directly.
- A minotaur navigator with a natural sense of direction within mazes can be recruited eventually to help them clear a path. (Cartel or Dredgers?)

### The Identity Verification
- Kyokutei will eventually provide the party a blood vial rumored to be filled with Miyatsuki's blood.
- A pendant the party finds will turn out to be Miyatsuki's relic; the party can learn of the relic's true name and use his voice to bypass the barrier.
