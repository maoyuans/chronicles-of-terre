When the seas are calm and the skys are clear, those standing on the bleached shores of [Peran](region/Peran) can often catch a glimpse of a golden tower, standing out far at sea, guarding the treasures of all of Terre. While such tales by drunken sailors in taverns might be part exaggeration, the Auric Lighthouse of Selchar is neither myth nor fiction, and stands high and haughty on the island of Selchar, home to the Grand Selchari Vault, the most secure bank and museum all across Terre. Within it locks countless artifacts and treasures, from crown jewels of kingdoms, to cursed swords of demon generals, to ancient spell scrolls of unaccountable origins. Every single item in the Vault has a different story behind it, yet every single one with no exception are worth hoards of treasures, if its value can be reasoned with at all.

Many envies the treasures the Grand Selchari Vault holds, be it thieves on the roads of [Maltross](region/Maltross) or academians locked high up within the Clock Tower at [Labyrinthine](region/Labyrinthine), yet few dares to trespass into the vault depths. Make no mistake: throughout history many have attempted to challenge the unbreakable vault, and many of these challengers experts of their own craft. Out of all of them, none have succeed. None. Beneath layers upon layers of guards and patrols, locks and mechanisms, glyphs and mazes, those fortunate or skilled enough to delve into the depth all met their end in the hands of a Vault Guardian.

Despite the fame and notority of the Grand Vault, the lower docks of Selchar still houses all the wanna-be's who daydream of wealth and success. Between thieves, pirates, and outlaws, many have to resort to waylaying merchant or traveller ships on their way to store, retrieve, visit, or steal, hoarding wealth, resources, and experience, before making a name for themselves, breaking the unbreakable vault, scoring the grandest heist of all time.

## The Grand Selchari Vault

Constructed by architects and engineers of the Perani Trading Corporation at the turn of the millennium, the Grand Selchari Vault has acted as the most prominent bank and museum of artifacts found across the land of Terre. Initially envisioned as an offshore asset storage for the higher executives of the Corporation, the Vault was quickly expanded in scale and functionality into a banking organization open to the entire continent, that puts selected items on exhibition, in order to establish the island of Selchar as a trading and tourism center in the middle of the Clearwater Gulf, and profit off the naval traffic.

The vault itself is located deep underground, with the reception lobby just below the main halls on the ground floor, housing the exhibitions. While the underground sections are usually closed off to the public, the Grand Selchari Vault offers tours of the defensive and security mechanisms safeguarding the vaults to potential customers. The design of the vault proper was led by Phillip M. Canter, a lead engineering consultant at the Trading Corporation with joint appointment at Fleethall at Maltross, and hosts a variety of features, but the finer details of the mechanisms are kept as top secrets. In addition to heavily-guarded corridors, there are also giant constructs that guards the inner gates, labyrinths constantly shifting and changing, and even mysterious barriers that does not allow passage unless you are simply the owner of the item you want to access.

The main halls of the vault are repurposed into a museum and exhibition open to the public. While not as heavily guarded, the area is still under heavy surveillance and reinforced with magic circles and glyphs engraved on the glass exhibit case as well as the area in general. Each artifact on show is unique and priceless, with a long history behind it - but for some reason, the experienced rogues and thieves with the ability to break through the exhibition don't seem too interested to pull a heist there, and instead focus their attention on the proper vault instead...
