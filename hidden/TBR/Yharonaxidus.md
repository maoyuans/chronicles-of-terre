# Yharonaxidus of the Apostasy

Yharonaxidus, Death-Seeker, is a true dragon who was granted mortality by Xbeltz'aloc. Dragons are between gods and mortals - capable of emotions yet having immortality. Most dragons seeked Godhood and ascension, but Yharonaxidus yearned to understand death and mortality. Xbeltz'aloc granted their wish and killed them, reanimating them as a draconic servant.
