# Issan's Maw

A small logging and mining settlement at the foot of Mount Taignos Range, towards the west of Taignos Pass. Located at the mouth of a treacherous passage through Mount Taignos Range into Okeanos, Issan's Maw unfortunately became a popular pitstop for smugglers from and to the secluded Provincial Empire, after its retreat from the rest of Terre, but since monsters populated the passage beyond the Maw, few reasons remain to visit this insignificant village, except for occasional explorers willing to brave the mountains.

Ruined camps and abandoned houses scatter around the proximity; Residents avert their eyes and shun away from visitors and each other alike; all signs foretell the inevitable decline of this place. While it can be dismissed as a decline in population moving out throughout the years, Issan's Maw has a reputation within the Church of Gloria as a haunted, cursed place. A massacre happened some years ago, in AC 1363, when a lone Glorian inquisitor investigated the village in response to cult activities in the mining tunnels, and executed most of its population after finding them guilty of collusion and harboring, since the miners elected to ignore the existence of cultist activities in aversion to trouble. The massacre earned him the infamy as 'The Reaper of Issan's Maw'.

The newly built Church of Issan's Maw sits just east of the entrance to the Maw, between most of the village and the cemetery ruins, in which lies also the ruins of the old church. Built hastily, it currently houses the local priest and a stationed inquisitor, and does not have the capacity to support more than that as its resident. The basement of the church is off-limits to the public.

### Abandoned Tunnels

One of the most excavated tunnels among many within the valley leading to the Maw. Raw gems and minerals were more than half of Issan's Maw's export before the massacre, so this tunnel sprawls several layers deep into the mountain side and the underground, driven by the abundance of iron and sapphire, and the rumors of cryonic ore struck in the deepest reaches.

A narrow side tunnel led to the mountainside east-northeast of the Maw's entrance, and
