# Issan's Maw

A small logging and mining settlement at the foot of Mount Taignos Range, towards the west of Taignos Pass. Located at the mouth of a treacherous passage through Mount Taignos Range into Okeanos, Issan's Maw unfortunately became a popular pitstop for smugglers from and to the secluded Provincial Empire, after its retreat from the rest of Terre, but since monsters populated the passage beyond the Maw, few reasons remain to visit this insignificant village, except for occasional explorers willing to brave the mountains.

Ruined camps and abandoned houses scatter around the proximity; Residents avert their eyes and shun away from visitors and each other alike; all signs foretell the inevitable decline of this place. While it can be dismissed as a decline in population moving out throughout the years, Issan's Maw has a reputation within the Church of Gloria as a haunted, cursed place. A massacre happened some years ago, in AC 1363, when a lone Glorian inquisitor investigated the village in response to cult activities in the mining tunnels, and executed most of its population after finding them guilty of collusion and harboring, since the miners elected to ignore the existence of cultist activities in aversion to trouble. The massacre earned him the infamy as 'The Reaper of Issan's Maw'.

## Locations of Interest

### Village Church

The newly built Church of Issan's Maw sits on the far southern edge of the village. Built hastily, it currently houses the local priest and a stationed inquisitor, and does not have the capacity to support more than that as its resident. 

### Abandoned Tunnels

One of the most excavated tunnels among many within the valley leading to the Maw. Raw gems and minerals were more than half of Issan's Maw's export before the massacre, so this tunnel sprawls several layers deep into the mountain side and the underground, driven by the abundance of iron and sapphire, and the rumors of cryonic ore from a comet that struck the mountains long ago.

A narrow side tunnel led to the mountainside east-northeast of the Maw's entrance, and was extensively used by first smugglers and then cultists. Until the massacre, that is, when the main and the side tunnels were all sealed shut by cave-ins both natural and artificial.

### The Maw

The titular mountain pass across Mount Taignos Range is a treacherous passage from and to the Provincial Empire of Okeanos. As opposed to Taignos Pass and the White Gate to the east, which was established, paved, and maintained by first the Forgotten Empire and then the Divine Glorian Empire, the Maw were never used in any official capacity, and instead served as a pathway for smugglers, criminals, and other less than legal activities, despite the dangers within.

For those daring or desperate enough to enter the Maw, once upon a time the village had maps to sell, depicting paths and crossings navigating the many frigid cliffs and ravines. An infamous rope bridge dangle above a deadly fall three hundred meters in height, if not more, swinging sideways violently in the almost constant mountain wind. There are also rumors that hidden along the path through the Maw is the lair of a dragon - despite their kind's departure aeons ago.

Nowadays, the village lies in ruins, and monsters have overrun the passage so much that none really cross the border anymore.

### Maw's Breath (Inn)

A lonely inn and tavern sitting at the crossroad in the middle of Issan's Maw. It used to be called the Maw's Breath, but nowadays it is just 'the inn'. 

Acting as the de-facto center of Issan's Maw, the inn is a two-story structure with the tavern and kitchen on the first, and three guest rooms on the second. Most of the village's residents find their way into the tavern in the after hours, since the kitchen and bar are the only ones functional enough to keep serving the entire village at large, after the rapid population decline in the recent years.

The tavernkeep, Julia, has been in charge of the inn for almost 20 years now, and has very much been considered a spokesperson of Issan's Maw, who knows her spirits well and knows her patrons better. When most villages are hesitant to speak with outsiders, let alone help or seek help, Julia tries her best to tie these threads up together and build bridges, as fragile and transient as these tend to be.

In more recent times, as the long winter approaches, the village's supply of food steadily decreases despite its resident's best efforts. Even the inn has less than ideal to offer, with some apparently unsolvable vermin problem in the cellars, nibbling away at all the crates and barrels...

### Carra's Farmstead

One of the remaining farmsteads supplying Issan's Maw with food and resources. Carra's farmstead is about three hours of travel southeast of Issan's Maw, and mainly produces vegetables like cabbages, onions, carrots, and potatoes. 

### Venlo's Farmstead

One of the farmsteads that used to supply Issan's Maw, about two hours west of Issan's Maw. Venlo's farmstead was mostly a poultry farm, supplying the village with chicken, turkey, grain, and corn, and was vital for the boreal winter months of the village. 

Quite recently, Venlo's farmstead went out of contact, and supplies haven't arrived for over a month. The tavernkeep, Julia, sent out people to investigate, but they returned with no response, strangely. Rumors are the farmstead has already fallen to ruin by bandits, or even something worse...

### Cemetery Ruins

On the eastern side of Issan's Maw lies the charred, collapsed ruins of homes of miners and excavators, destroyed during the massacre. Many families were buried under the rubbles when their house burnt down, never given proper burial, and left to lament their tragic end.

Instead of a clean-up operation to clear out the ruins, residents of Issan's Maw built a high fence and gated the ruins off. Perhaps the sight of the ruinous village is too much to bear, or perhaps there is just not enough manpower to spare. Fortunately, the presence of undead within the mass cemetery is largely contained, without a deity to champion them.
