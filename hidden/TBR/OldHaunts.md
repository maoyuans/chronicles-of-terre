# Old Haunts

Villagers of the secluded island of Mortgart, part of the Inselundi Barony at the northeastern part of Albion's March, have long been plagued by undeads and monsters, but problems seem excessively severe this spring. Burdened by the many reports of 'hauntings' at the ancient manor on top of the northern hills, with flickering lights and evil laughters and sightings of skeletons around, the village elder was forced to seek the help of the more capable residents and visitors to brave the manor grounds and solve the hauntings, if not once and for all, at least for the season being.
