# The Star Eater

## ????a?? 14th, ?73? BA

Xochipilli / Xochipilli / forsake us not

light in the dark / forsake us not

(Your) veiled beauty / why do you hide

Eyes disturb / the sin of knowing

(We) see the sin / the star-eater

Mother and Father / Xbeltz'aloc / forsake us not

## Ertos 22nd, 1125 AC

Professor Martonne,

It is day 33 of the excavation. Attached are the transcripts of slate 14. 14 is the most well-preserved among all slates, so that we are able to identify all scripts and establish correspondence to their contemporary counterpart words. Do you agree with the correspondence? If so, this could be a huge linguistic breakthrough in reconstructing pre-ascension oldtongue.

14 seems to record a poem - perhaps an invocation to Xbeltz'aloc? - that describes a disaster striking the tribe. I recall our site near Millictl finding similarly fashioned slate, only missing most of its content, so it is possible that the two slates are themed similarly? I should write them to ask for their slate to be transported over.

What I find curious is that the word "star-eater" seems to be a direct concatenation of "star" and "... who eats" in contemporary oldtongue. Maybe this suggests that these words did not evolve at all over the past millenia? Anyways.

## Recording: Nocturne Parade

Snuff out the light, have to hide. Hear distant screams?

## Diagnosis: Tinnitus

Labyrinthine's triage team thinks it's just tinnitus, trauma related. Briefly mention dreams.

## Diary: To see stars

Can't sleep, go out for a walk. The stars seems different, much less stars, some disappear in a blink. Maybe vision problems too.

## Letter: Other slates

Slates from other sites arrived: they record the exact same poem. Confusion as to why. A larger meaning?

## Dream: Ascendant and witch

Old times; the heavily ill ascendant is visited by an occult witch, who prophesied his death. A star disappears.

## Diary: Dream and screams

Diary page; more and more strange dreams and tinnitus, devolving into madness now.

## Letter: Response to order

Lord Aslingarde has instructed archaeology to vacate the site. Reasons unclear. Prof Martonne protests in a letter. Mentions lack of report and missing personnel. Date earlier.

## Recording: A visitor

Someone arrived to take protag somewhere.

## Obituary

Announcement of death of name redacted. Killed by the parade, throat mangled.

## Sometime somewhere

The stars disappear. The scream remains. The screams die down. Have to hide ourselves. Silence self to keep others not silent.
