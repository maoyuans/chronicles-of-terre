# The Star Eater

## ????a?? 14??, ?73? BA

Xochipilli / Xochipilli / forsake us not

light in the dark / forsake us not

(Your) veiled beauty / why do you hide

Eyes disturb / the sin of knowing

(We) see the sin / the star-eater

Mother and Father / Xbeltz'aloc / forsake us not

## Ertos 22nd, AC 1125

Professor Martonne,

It is day 33 of the excavation. Attached are the transcripts of slate 14. 14 is the most well-preserved among all slates, so that we are able to identify all scripts and establish correspondence to their contemporary counterpart words. Do you agree with the correspondence? If so, this could be a huge linguistic breakthrough in reconstructing pre-ascension oldtongue.

14 seems to record a poem - perhaps an invocation to Xbeltz'aloc? - that describes a disaster striking the tribe. I recall our site near Millictl finding similarly fashioned slate, only missing most of its content, so it is possible that the two slates are themed similarly? I should write them to ask for their slate to be transported over.

What I find curious is that the word "star-eater" seems to be a direct concatenation of "star" and "... who eats" in contemporary oldtongue. Maybe this suggests that these words did not evolve at all over the past millenia? Compared to a lot of other linguistic evolutions, this is certainly an interesting phenomenon.

*[Hurried footsteps approach. A door is quickly slam shut, followed by heavy breathing.]*

"...hah, hahh. By the Storm, what is... what is happening?"

"Come on, *[static]* you know what to do. Snuff out the-the lights, shut the windows, be quiet. Stay quiet. Stay quiet... Stay q-quiet. Quiet. Hide."

*[Heavy breathing continues. Quick, hurried footsteps, interrupted by creaking wood planks, and an exacerbated gasp. The sound of furniture dragging against wood floor.]*

"*[unintelligible]* did I do? The Parade shouldn't be this angry - as-as long as we follow the protocols. Did I...? *[page turning]* No, no no no, not now. Keep quiet. Hide yourself."

*[Dead silence. A gasp.]* "I-it comes, The Travelers be with me..."

*[A distant humming can be heard, and quickly amplifies into a howling, snarling, wailing wind. Wooden walls and frames creak agains the impact. The cacophony persists for approximately two minutes before slowly fading away, leaving only faint, but audible heavy breathing.]*

"I-is it gone? Am I- *[hurried steps]* It's so... dark. Why is it s-so dark out there..."

"I-I wonder if the others are ok. *[page turning]* I need to inform t-the Guild abou- Wait, what is-"

*[Silence.]* "...what is that screaming?"

## Diary: To see stars

Can't sleep, go out for a walk. The stars seems different, much less stars, some disappear in a blink. Maybe vision problems too.

## A Theory of the dark forest

## Letter: Other slates

Slates from other sites arrived: they record the exact same poem. Confusion as to why. A larger meaning?

## Dream: Ascendant and witch

Old times; the heavily ill ascendant is visited by an occult witch, who prophesied his death. A star disappears.

## Diary: Dream and screams

Diary page; more and more strange dreams and tinnitus, devolving into madness now.

## Letter: Response to order

Lord Aslingarde has instructed archaeology to vacate the site. Reasons unclear. Prof Martonne protests in a letter. Mentions lack of report and missing personnel. Date earlier.

## Recording: A visitor

Someone arrived to take protag somewhere.

## Obituary

Announcement of death of name redacted. Killed by the parade, throat mangled.

## Sometime somewhere

The stars disappear. The scream remains. The screams die down. Have to hide ourselves. Silence self to keep others not silent.
