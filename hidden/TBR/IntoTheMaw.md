# Into the Maw

## Sangnis

Five months after the disasters as Sangnis, the party will receive correspondence from Butio, about aiding a old friend of his. Of the party, only Sebastian would respond, while Zeekquirrk would refer to Dalor Bramblefoot, an acquaintance of hers. The two will meet at the tavern in Sangnis, to find a mysterious tiefling noblewoman from Okeanos, with the name of Lucia Veritania Azalea, accompanied by Sytri Hawkins, a strange man to all three of them.

Sangnis has seen a steady process of reconstruction in the past months, spearheaded by local priest Galter Lorenzon. While the Crimson curse still occasionally manifests itself, sending small packs of tainted beasts towards the village, Hasili Suntrace, the paladin of Fass, has been able to fend them off after recovering from his injuries.

Galter helped Azalea, who escaped Okeanos inland after contracting the Crimson Curse. He recognized that Azalea's Curse behaves quite differently than the mindless infestation that other creatures exhibit, and sheltered her so that she can recover from the travels. Azalea learned the party's involvement, and recognized Butio, thus contacted him for assistance.

## Road to the Maw

Azalea is upfront about his goals of returning to Okeanos to find out who is behind the Crimson Curse. She is adamant about visiting Issan's Maw first to retrieve lost items.

The party would encounter bandits on the road to Issan's Maw, a two-day travel. Azalea refrains from using anything further than daggers and pistols, and would only show her power if situations are dire.

At night the party would awaken to Azalea attempting to fight a bear. She needs to drink blood to quell her Curse, in lieu of ample supply of the Blood.

The party might encounter a camp of bandit-mercenaries hunting a lonesome tiefling - without knowledge of Azalea's in-party status.

## Issan's Maw

A destitute settlement near the Taignos Mountains bordering DGE and Okeanos. The Maw, a lesser-known, more treacherous pass through the mountain range is located behind the village. Most of the village is destroyed in an inquisition some 50 years ago.

The village is in general afraid of outsiders, and will be hesitant to give any help or information without a lengthy trust-building process. Additionally, there are rumors of a hooded individual spreading a disease around the village...

Azalea on her journey inland passed through Issan's Maw, and almost lost control of herself, driven crazy by some unknown presence near the entrance to the Maw. She lost a case of Blood vials, vital to her sustenance, and one more vial picked up by Adrian the local drunk, which caused him to get infected by the Crimson Curse as well. Marcho, the cook at the inn, will recognize Azalea.

## Village Quests

- The local church's inquisitor is prone to getting drunk and belligerent at the tavern. At some time he will confront Adrian's disappearance, or Adrian himself in the tavern cellar.
- The cellar is rumored to have rat issues that exacerbated the recent famine. There are noises coming from the cellar when it is quiet at night. Adrian the town drunk is hiding inside the cellar, after contracting the Curse from Azalea's Blood vial. Some part of the village's catch is used to feed him blood, and alcohol inundated his senses and helps quell the Curse.
- Julia knows the daughter of a previous cartographer that used to chart the Maw and make maps for travelers. His tools and charting data are still buried in the Cemetery Ruins, with undead problems sometimes.
- Local thief/drunk/urchin can be convinced to reclaim Venlo's farmstead to restart the poultry supply for the village.
- Traces of smugglers and other shady stuffs. A smuggler's den operating under Carra's farmstead. They have possibly illegally sourced stuffs, exotic items, and also odd sorts of jobs to give. Maybe - blackmail, getting documents from Venlo's farm, the local church, etc.

## Abandoned Tunnels

Mining tunnels at the mouth of the maw, used to be source of main export of Issan's Maw, but then there's cult, and miners got inquisitioned, blah blah. Contains many gems ores and rumors of a comet.

The main dungeon for part 1 of the campaign. Four levels, with the crater of the comet in the last. The comet shard is stimulating the Crimson Curse into overdrive nearby, attracting all kinds of tainted or crimson monsters dwelling in the tunnels.

Azalea lost her Blood case near the entrance, and thinks that her case is in the tunnels, which is why she is so agitated. The comet is the real cause.

Julia will ask the party to figure out how to solve the problem, if they want, or for a favor of some kind.

### Tunnel Structure

The Abandoned Tunnels are divided into four level, each approximately designed for one character level, from 4th to 7th. The four levels forms a loosely downward slope, starting from the entrance to the Maw, going west to east into the mountain, before turning going south to north around the second level. A main shaft descends until the end of the third level, providing easy access once the various blockages are cleared. There are a few smaller passages between levels, some of them one-way descents, some of them too small for medium-sized creatures. The final section of the third level and the fourth level are composed of primitive tunnels dug by either miners or other creatures, and lacks a central shaft.

### First Level - Mineshaft

The first level is themed as a ordinary mineshaft - only overrun by tainted creatures. The central shaft descends from the entrance on the west towards the east. There is a few blockages in the central shaft; some can be cleared with explosives, some too heavy to clear and must be circumvented. The side shafts are relatively artificial, straight with sharp turns and little curves.

The part of the central shaft towards the second level is blocked by heavy rubble and cannot be traversed. A chamber on the side holds a tunnel downwards, but is occupied by the boss of the floor - a hoarding spider that collects all kinds of rocks and minerals. Defeating the spider allows clearing the webbing and advancing to the next level.

- A room is blocked off by a cloud of toxic gas - which originates from a gas leak on the second level. The room contains coins and pools of poison that can be extracted. The party can attempt to detonate the gas cloud, but the gas will refill in a short while, making the room dangerous to venture into without quick reaction. Disabling the gas leak on the second level will make the cloud dissipate.
- There are support beams that will collapse when walked near. Can be detected as traps, and can be used to close off tunnels or damage enemies.
- A heavily cobwebbed area contains a venomous spider nest. The spiders will battle tainted creatures and the party. Guarding gemstones and webbed gauntlets.
- A dysfunctional elevator that must be repaired. There are mechanical parts around the first and second level. A repair manual is somewhere on the second floor, that allows someone to repair it with higher success rate. The elevator descends into the second level in a room with weapons. The room is locked from the inside. The elevator also descends into the third floor in a peripheral tunnel, but the tunnel is blocked from the outside.
- Explosive pouches, bundles, and barrels are scattered across the mineshaft. Can be used to clear tunnels and collapses. Some explosives are unstable and might cause injuries.
- A room with high ceilings and exposed silver ore veins. Uhhhh vertical combat region. Some pushing?
- A section of the level overrun by tainted monsters. Expect a lot of blood and eating each other (?)
- A minecart on rail that leads to a blockage. Supposed to load the cart with explosives and clear the blockage into treasure, gold, potions, and shit.

### Second Level - Cultists

The second level is themed around cultist activities that used to shadow the mineshaft and Issan's Maw. The central shaft continues from the first level on the west, but turns sharp in the middle and towards the north. The central shaft is mostly clear of blockages, but a ravine spans the middle of the floor and support has collapsed mostly. There are some natural cave tunnels but most of the side tunnels are mined out.

The central shaft towards the third level is blocked off by a collapse caused by the Reaper - but there are no other passages towards the third level. An abandoned mining drill using Perani technology is near the blockage. The party needs to search energy cells that power the drill. Once the drill starts digging, it will draw in a lot of monsters including tainted and natural inhabitants - and maybe undeads. The party must defend themselves and the drill until it digs through the blockage.

- The toxic gas cloud on the first floor comes from a pipe leak in a section on this floor. The party can attempt to seal it with some poison resistance gear or potion (conveniently found ont he floor). Sealing it will remove the gas leak, but redirect the gas to cause an explosion on ground level outside of the village. The pipe comes from a processing machine on the third floor - and the party can switch it off to solve all problems.
- A lot of glowing moss that illuminates the floor.
- A room locked from the inside that contains magical weapons and treasures and the elevator. The party should enter from the first floor after fixing he elevator.
- A section near the south-east corner that is entirely over the ravine. Parkour or construction required? Maybe?
- Rigged explosives because why not. The cultists need defenses.
- A section near the south-west corner that is a cultist hideout. There's also smuggling happening. There will be profit. There is also a lot of undead and stuffs.
- A room with strange pentagram rituals, that is almost complete. Please do not complete it. It will summon a demon, and I will have to write fiend lore for that.
- The barracks/bunkers for cultists, turned into essentially a mass grave by the Reaper. A LOT of undead there. But also some cultist themed treasure idk.
- A hidden tunnel that the cultists and smugglers use to quickly enter and exit the mines. Leads to a hiddel alcove out of town.
- A passageway into the third level hidden under the ravine. The party is not supposed to find this until they come from the third level side.

### Third Level - Elementals

The third level is themed around elementals and golems, ice and fire, caused by residual elemental energy of the cryonic ore that the miners were after. The central shaft extends further into the mountain, going south to north, but varying in width and angle due to hardened rock profile, and ends at the middle of this level. A large part of the level consists of natural caverns, and features ice, water, and lava.

There are various small tunnels towards the fourth level, one around the lava area, another around the ice area. The lava area tunnel is in a lava river flowing downwards, and is hard to access; The ice area tunnel is guarded by an ice elemental who is hostile to the party. The ice elemental draws heat from around it and vents heat to the other side of the central shaft, causing polar environments. Defeating the ice elemental is not required to advance - it can be argued with, but is very stubborn and will attack.

- A tunnel in the south-western corner that connects to the elevator from the previous floors. The tunnel is blocked by a cave-in that is safe to clear from the third floor direction, allowing quick access in the future.
- A section in the north wall between the ice and the lava that is submersed in water. There are water pumps left by the miners that can be repaired and activated to drain the water. The section contains a tunnel to the fourth level, but it drops down into an underwater area that the water pumps cannot reach.
- A small cave in the south that leads to the underside of the ravine of the second floor. The party can see another hidden treasure on the cliffside that they can return to the second floor to retrieve.
- The beginning of the central shaft that was blocked off by the Reaper contains many corpses of miners, trapped within the cave when the massacre happens. No undead this time, they deserve a rest after the drilling event last floor.
- Near the end of the central shaft to the east, a control chamber that can activate the water pump, stop the gas leak, along with various other useless functions. The processor is malfunctional due to the increased temperature.
- Exploding crystals. Lava bubbles bursting.
- Mining equipments possessed by uhhhh mutant flesh monsters idk.
- TBD?

### Fourth Level - Cosmic

The fourth level is themed around cosmic creatures as well as tainted creatures overdriven by the comet. The fourth level is much smaller in size compared to the other levels, and consists of narrow artificial and natural tunnels, fractured during meteor impact, or excavated by the miners. A lot of crystals exist within the cave system from the impact.

Most of the paths to the comet impact site is sealed off by a shell. One large tunnel was assaulted by a strong tainted creature (boss, to be designed), which weakened the wall to allow demolition.

The meteor impact site is a large and empty cavern with a comet shard in the middle. The party approaching the comet shard will be dragged into an encounter with the cosmic messenger.

- The south-middle section is submersed in water. There is no water pump but there's uhhhh treasure. Yeah. The mandatory underwater section. Also man-eating fishes.
- Some of the crystals are... Exalting crystals. They are alchemical blanks that does not react to magics really. Make up some lore - it's reaccuring elements. It's gonna be useless and interesting.
- Some of the crystals are... mind-controlling? They will make the party obsessed with them, absolutely. Idk what they will do with it, make shit up on the fly.


## Lucia Veritania Azalea

Mysterious tiefling from Okeanos, wants to figure out who 'V' is. Suspects own father, who is doing some weird shit. Asking the party for assistance.

Escaped Okeanos for 'reasons', unwilling to say upfront, claims family issues. Inflicted with the Crimson Curse (Accursed Blood Warlock), avoids using magical power.

She asks the party to retrieve lost items around Issan's Maw. Unwilling to venture into the Maw without it. Gets very annoyed and agitated near the Maw.

She lost a case full of vials of Blood (capital B) near Issan's Maw, from some unknown source driving her curse haywire into near frenzy. With a few more stray vials lost on the road, she is barely able to keep control of herself.

The abandoned tunnels are infested by tainted beasts and crimson monsters, and seems to drive her crazy too. The source of this frenzy is a comet that struck Terre long ago, buried at the end of the tunnels.

## The Blood case

Azalea contracted the Crimson Curse somehow - she conjects from his father's obsession. She stole a couple vials of Blood from her family and escaped with it.

The case got lost near Issan's Maw, specifically near the Abandoned tunnels. Azalea suspects that the case is inside the tunnels.

The case was snatched by a hoarding giant raven into a forest nearby. The giant raven got mutated.

## Sebastian

The same old Sebastian, former lecturer at some college in rural DGE, somehow married in the past half an year and now am forced to go out and get some money by his wife...?

Seb is prone being contacted about. odd, legally and morally ambiguous jobs and tasks. 

After taking on odd jobs here and there, Seb might get contacted about a hit on a certain dangerous individual. The Veritania family sends mercenaries to capture Azalea and bring her back. Huge reward.

POSSIBLE PLOT: 
Seb runs into an old colleague and the biggest hater of his work.
Seb learns about an ancient book of great jokes - wtf?

## Butio

## Sytri Hawkins

A fallen aasimar twilight cleric of Astarte, goddess of love, wandering around DGE to preach... openness, honesty, and acceptance of one's own desires. Hopelessly masochistic.

Sytri met Azalea as she's beating up bandits attempting to rob her. After repeatedly ignoring her warning and approaching her nonetheless, he got beat unconscious but woke up and managed to follow her track again. Repeat a few times she's too tired to beat him up and instead just scolded him. Repeat a few times more she realized that's also not a good idea and now just ignores him...

He simps too hard, but Azalea realized there's really nothing she can do, and since Sytri hasn't done anything to harm her yet... She'll just ignore him.

Sytri doesn't have direct reasons to deal with the Curse but he simps for Azalea. Potential romance plot of him finding out what Azalea likes and how to impress her... idfk just go wing it.

Sytri might be impressed by the tainted and crimson monster's regenerative abilities... and would want a piece of it, maybe, if it is possible for one to contract the curse while keeping their sanity. Present opportunities...?

## Dalor Bramblefoot

A dwarven moon druid + barbarian, who got tired of training, and left the circle to live with primitive tribals in the outskirts of Yharn. His tribe got wiped by Cursed creatures, and now he is without an aim, looking for the meaning of life.

Dalor knows Zeekquirrk, and the latter forwarded him a letter when news of one of Butio's old friend requesting assistance came, which is why he came to Sangnis. He is very hostile to the curse and would rather just wipe it out asap.

Dalor does not take druidism and balance that seriously - that being a druid may not be all he wants. He might have new understandings about the meaning of druidism within the campaign, especially after realizing that the Crimson Curse is as Xbeltz'aloc intends.

Marcho, once he warms up to Dalor, will find ways to teach Dalor how to cook. Give him encounters about... fishing, cooking, etc. See if he takes the bite.

Verzae Legionnaires have caught wind of Azalea's presence, and would like to get rid of her one way or another. Have Dalor run into these fellow druids, and see what he does.

## Friends and Foe from Foreign Places

There are a lot of different factions and groups after Azalea and her power.

The Verzae Legion caught wind of an Okeanosian mage with blood magic. They want her gone, despite her staying clear of Verzae territory.

The Veritania family wants to capture her and bring her back to Okeanos, or on worst case, kill her. Azalea escaped as a witness to the family's and higher Okeanosian society's indulgence of the Blood, and after stealing from her father.

Mercenaries working for Vasilius, the Crimson General, would like to help Azalea and the party enter Okeanos. Vasilius is behind the Blood issues within her family, and gave her the Curse, to lure capable adventurers into Okeanos. He wants to recruit adventurers, and/or 'help' Azalea to master the Curse and become a perfect monster.

## Ataraxia

Lady Ataraxia would contact the party when they need help or after they first enter the mines. She wants the celestial creature and the comet gone.

Personally Lady Ataraxia wouldn't care about the Crimson Curse - if anything, it would seem like a great ally for her. She would hold a neutral attitude towards the Curse, and related topic, but ultimately provide reasonable aid to the party.

## The Reaper of Issan's Maw

The Reaper of Issan's Maw, Mallick Trost, is the Glorian inquisitor that caused the massacre at Issan's Maw some 49 years ago. Various parties hold differing opinions on his actions, but by the word of the law of the  Empire and the tenet of the Church, his actions are just. The fanatics' sect ultimately stationed him in Bladefall, as an inquisitor captain for his pious following of Gloria, and suppressed the mentioning of the massacre at large.

A main concern of the villagers would be catching the attention of Trost or the fanatics in general, thus remain hostile or evasive of the party. They will often make mentions of the Reaper. If the party decides to confront the local inquisitor to a large degree, he will eventually arrange for the arrival of Trost.

Trost is a high-level vengeance paladin of Glory who is gifted power by Gloria. The party is not expected to defeat him in combat - and should instead resort to persuasion and other methods to convince him to leave the village alone, or target the most important threat.
