# Into the Maw

## Issan's Maw

A destitute settlement near the Taignos Mountains bordering DGE and Okeanos. The Maw, a lesser-known, more treacherous pass through the mountain range is located behind the village. Most of the village is destroyed in an inquisition some 50 years ago.

The village is in general afraid of outsiders, and will be hesitant to give any help or information without a lengthy trust-building process. Additionally, there are rumors of a hooded individual spreading a disease around the village...

Azalea on her journey inland passed through Issan's Maw, and almost lost control of herself, driven crazy by some unknown presence near the entrance to the Maw. She lost a case of Blood vials, vital to her sustenance, and one more vial picked up by Adrian the local drunk, which caused him to get infected by the Crimson Curse as well. Marcho, the cook at the inn, will recognize Azalea.

## Village Quests

- The local church's inquisitor is prone to getting drunk and belligerent at the tavern. At some time he will confront Adrian's disappearance, or Adrian himself in the tavern cellar.
- The cellar is rumored to have rat issues that exacerbated the recent famine. There are noises coming from the cellar when it is quiet at night. Adrian the town drunk is hiding inside the cellar, after contracting the Curse from Azalea's Blood vial. Some part of the village's catch is used to feed him blood, and alcohol inundated his senses and helps quell the Curse.
- Julia knows the daughter of a previous cartographer that used to chart the Maw and make maps for travelers. His tools and charting data are still buried in the Cemetery Ruins, with undead problems sometimes.
- Local thief/drunk/urchin can be convinced to reclaim Venlo's farmstead to restart the poultry supply for the village.
- Traces of smugglers and other shady stuffs. A smuggler's den operating behind Carra's farmstead. They have possibly illegally sourced stuffs, exotic items, and also odd sorts of jobs to give. Maybe - blackmail, getting documents from Venlo's farm, the local church, etc.

## Abandoned Tunnels

Mining tunnels at the mouth of the maw, used to be source of main export of Issan's Maw, but then there's cult, and miners got inquisitioned, blah blah. Contains many gems ores and rumors of a comet.

The main dungeon for part 1 of the campaign. Four levels, with the crater of the comet in the last. The comet shard is stimulating the Crimson Curse into overdrive nearby, attracting all kinds of tainted or crimson monsters dwelling in the tunnels.

Azalea lost her Blood case near the entrance, and thinks that her case is in the tunnels, which is why she is so agitated. The comet is the real cause.

Julia will ask the party to figure out how to solve the problem, if they want, or for a favor of some kind.

## Lucia Veritania Azalea

Mysterious tiefling from Okeanos, wants to figure out who 'V' is. Suspects own father, who is doing some weird shit. Asking the party for assistance.

Escaped Okeanos for 'reasons', unwilling to say upfront, claims family issues. Inflicted with the Crimson Curse (Accursed Blood Warlock), avoids using magical power.

She asks the party to retrieve lost items around Issan's Maw. Unwilling to venture into the Maw without it. Gets very annoyed and agitated near the Maw.

She lost a case full of vials of Blood (capital B) near Issan's Maw, from some unknown source driving her curse haywire into near frenzy. With a few more stray vials lost on the road, she is barely able to keep control of herself.

The abandoned tunnels are infested by tainted beasts and crimson monsters, and seems to drive her crazy too. The source of this frenzy is a comet that struck Terre long ago, buried at the end of the tunnels.

## The Blood case

Azalea contracted the Crimson Curse somehow - she conjects from his father's obsession. She stole a couple vials of Blood from her family and escaped with it.

The case got lost near Issan's Maw, specifically near the Abandoned tunnels. Azalea suspects that the case is inside the tunnels.

The case was snatched by a hoarding giant raven into a forest nearby. The giant raven got mutated.

## Sebastian

The same old Sebastian, former lecturer at some college in rural DGE, somehow married in the past half an year and now am forced to go out and get some money by his wife...?

Seb is prone being contacted about. odd, legally and morally ambiguous jobs and tasks. 

After taking on odd jobs here and there, Seb might get contacted about a hit on a certain dangerous individual. The Veritania family sends mercenaries to capture Azalea and bring her back. Huge reward.

POSSIBLE PLOT: 
Seb runs into an old colleague and the biggest hater of his work.
Seb learns about an ancient book of great jokes - wtf?

## Butio

## Sytri Hawkins

A fallen aasimar twilight cleric of Astarte, goddess of love, wandering around DGE to preach... openness, honesty, and acceptance of one's own desires. Hopelessly masochistic.

Sytri met Azalea as she's beating up bandits attempting to rob her. After repeatedly ignoring her warning and approaching her nonetheless, he got beat unconscious but woke up and managed to follow her track again. Repeat a few times she's too tired to beat him up and instead just scolded him. Repeat a few times more she realized that's also not a good idea and now just ignores him...

He simps too hard, but Azalea realized there's really nothing she can do, and since Sytri hasn't done anything to harm her yet... She'll just ignore him.

Sytri doesn't have direct reasons to deal with the Curse but he simps for Azalea. Potential romance plot of him finding out what Azalea likes and how to impress her... idfk just go wing it.

Sytri might be impressed by the tainted and crimson monster's regenerative abilities... and would want a piece of it, maybe, if it is possible for one to contract the curse while keeping their sanity. Present opportunities...?

## Dalor Bramblefoot

A dwarven moon druid + barbarian, who got tired of training, and left the circle to live with primitive tribals in the outskirts of Yharn. His tribe got wiped by Cursed creatures, and now he is without an aim, looking for the meaning of life.

Dalor knows Zeekquirrk, and the latter forwarded him a letter when news of one of Butio's old friend requesting assistance came, which is why he came to Sangnis. He is very hostile to the curse and would rather just wipe it out asap.

Dalor does not take druidism and balance that seriously - that being a druid may not be all he wants. He might have new understandings about the meaning of druidism within the campaign, especially after realizing that the Crimson Curse is as Xbeltz'aloc intends.

Marcho, once he warms up to Dalor, will find ways to teach Dalor how to cook. Give him encounters about... fishing, cooking, etc. See if he takes the bite.

Verzae Legionnaires have caught wind of Azalea's presence, and would like to get rid of her one way or another. Have Dalor run into these fellow druids, and see what he does.

## Friends and Foe from Foreign Places

There are a lot of different factions and groups after Azalea and her power.

The Verzae Legion caught wind of an Okeanosian mage with blood magic. They want her gone, despite her staying clear of Verzae territory.

The Veritania family wants to capture her and bring her back to Okeanos, or on worst case, kill her. Azalea escaped as a witness to the family's and higher Okeanosian society's indulgence of the Blood, and after stealing from her father.

Mercenaries working for Vasilius, the Crimson General, would like to help Azalea and the party enter Okeanos. Vasilius is behind the Blood issues within her family, and gave her the Curse, to lure capable adventurers into Okeanos. He wants to recruit adventurers, and/or 'help' Azalea to master the Curse and become a perfect monster.

## Ataraxia

Lady Ataraxia would contact the party when they need help or after they first enter the mines. She wants the celestial creature and the comet gone.
