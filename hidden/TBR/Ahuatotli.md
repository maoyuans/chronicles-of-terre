# Ahuatotli

Ahuatotli, otherwise known as Deathbringer Ahuatotli, or Xbeltz’aloci Avatar, is a humanoid/beast hybrid monster found deep within ??? in the jungles of [Yharn](../../region/Yharn). He is a champion of [Xbeltz'aloc](../../religion/patronus/Xbeltz'aloc), acting according to his ideals, protecting ??? from intruders, and if necessary searching the jungles of Yharn to purge those who escaped from death.

Xahuitotli was known as Clovis Pardieux, an alchemist and necromancer associated with the [Mages' Guild](../../region/Labyrinthine) in around AC 850. Afflicted with server thanatophobia, he pursued immortality through extending the life expectancy of the human body, and conducted experiments to augment the flesh and blood, earning him infamy in the Clock Tower and the unfortunate attention of Xbeltz’aloc. 

Clovis was lured into the jungles of Yharn and trapped by Xbeltz’aloc in ???. He was tormented and warped by the Crimson Curse into a maddened monstrosity, and given the name Ahuatotli as he slowly succumbed to Xbeltz’aloci ideals. Clovis, or Ahuatotli's wish for immortality was partially granted as he lives as an immortal champion of the God of Death, driven by purposeful instinct alone.
