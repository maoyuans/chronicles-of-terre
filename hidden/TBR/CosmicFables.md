## Myriad

The famine has ravaged her family, her fields, and her grumbling stomach. The girl shambles along the high road running next to the village, scrounging desperately for scraps of grain, calling out to the noble carriages riding by, both to no avail.

A glint of light caught her eyes, off the road and into the bushes painted wildfire by the dusking sky. Old folk tales of feys and wisps warn her to ignore these signs, but hunger champions over rationale in hard times.

She is greeted with a serene meadow, hidden behind branches and vines, seemingly otherworldly compared to the drought and famine without. She can hear the singing and chiming of insects and birds --- like a midsummer night's dream in the girl's distant memories.

The glint greets her silently. Standing in the middle of the meadow is a shard of quaint, azure crystals, glowing and pulsing gently. This might fetch a good price, the girl thinks. She reaches out to the shard, sending a prayer to the stars.

And then there is falling. She opens her eyes to an infinite expanse of space, filled with brilliant colors.

She sees father and brother bent down in the fields, hands scraped and scarred from all the extra farm work that yet yields no fruit; she sees the royal collectors, holding that scepter to block away pleading hands, while their soldiers load baskets of rice and grain onto the carriage; she glances oceans of flame, howling like a thousand wolves, burning down forests and groves in the far hills.

The girl cannot avert her eyes.

She watches as fires burn and fade, lights come and go, days fly past, years went by. She sees the ancestors peek out from their hiding caves, hoping that danger has diverted its attention for now; she sees strange men and women, dressed in absurd garments, playing witchcrafts dwarfing her wildest imaginations; she hears the cackling and snickering of shadows, shapeless without form, laughing from behind the veil at this world she hates yet holds dear.

Then she sees herself, walking though time and tide, off the high roads, into the meadow, putting her hand onto that shard of brilliant light, again and again.

And then there is nothing at all. Her hand feels only cold autumn wind. The shard is no where to be found. It was but a moments' passing, a midsummer night's dream.

She feels as if she has come to know this world, yet without any strand of comprehension.

## The Void

"Cardinal to Nest, I am at the quarry, descending in thirty seconds, over."

Without waiting for a reply, the man shuts down his transmitter, jams it into his jacket pocket, and rappels down the wall of this building. The midnight glory of Barohaven high above from the upper floors does not illuminate this part of the Midtown, nor the sewer houses further below. He is well-accustomed to these environments, however --- the ace detective of the Investigation Bureau have too many cases on his belt to be fazed by simple darkness and some depravity. 

And he just want to finish this case quickly and go back to home.

Descending in silence, with only the light, unperceived tapping of his foot on the bleached brick walls, Cardinal lets his thought loose for a moment. Rap, tap, tap. How many times had he done so over the past years, hanging on by a thread between life and death, between heaven and hell? Rap, tap, tap. These reckless ventures feel routine to him at the current point, like chores on a Tuesday afternoon.

Rap, tap, tap. Fourty-seven, fourty-six, fourty-five. The tappings halt along with the descent --- this should be where the cult hideout is operating from. The detective flips his wrist, locking the mounted pulley mechanism in place, and with his other hand pulls out the shock pistol from the holster. 

Quiet chantings leak through the shut curtains behind the window besides him, oblivious of what is about to strike.
> *"Omnia nihil, omnia licent."*
> 
> *"Omnia nihil, omnia licent."*

"Is that so..." Cardinal lets out a long sigh. Maybe this time, these cultists are onto something after all. Sometimes it does feel like what they said. Time and time again he struggles to find some dose of adrenaline from these works, as he did in ample amount in greener times; nowadays, there's only an infinite expanse of void where his burning beating heart once was.

He shakes off the irrelevant thoughts. Repelling off the walls, Cardinal swings quickly towards the window. The glass panels shatter immediately as the kick impacts the frame; The detective lands just beside the podium. With a quick shot of his pistol driven solely by instincts, the masked figure leading the chant falls to the ground, body spasming and speech slurred by the sudden shock.

The quiet, ordered chanting comes to a sudden halt from the interruption, and a few exacerbated gasps that follow. Raising up his free hand, Cardinal opens up his holo-shield, anticipating the barrage of bolts and missiles that will assault him quickly, as per routine.

However, only silence follows this time. His eyes sweeps across the room in surprise; Behind the holographic membrane protecting him from nothing, couple dozens of masks watch him quietly. Featureless, smooth, a perfectly cut opal without defect, void of content. These masks make him uncomfortable.

"Hmph. No welcome party? That's a first." He mumbles. Keeping his shielded stance intact, Cardinal flicks up the pendant that fell to the ground with the masked speaker, catching it with his pistol hand. "This is the piece, hmm?" The detective examines the onyx on the pendant quickly, before turning to the silent cultists below the podium stage, "Now scram, all of you, before I change my-"

"Halt... you-... take not..." A few words struggle to jump in between the tremblings behind the mask of the speaker. Cardinal looks to the side, down at the electrocuted cultist.

"Oh shut it. What is this to you anyways, or your meaningless worships? Isn't it as you said, that *all is void, all is-*"

Something trembles in his heart. The detective drops what he is holding, and reaches for his face. His touch is greeted by sweet nothingness --- all his fingertips feel are just a featureless, smooth sensation.

Falling to the ground, the man scrambles to pick up the pendant again. He doesn't know since when, but in the reflection within the onyx gemstone, his face has donned the perfectly cut mask as well.
