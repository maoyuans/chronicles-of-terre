# Cosmic Fables

---
## Myriad

The famine has ravaged her family, her fields, and her grumbling stomach. The girl shambles along the high road running next to the village, scrounging desperately for scraps of grain, calling out to the noble carriages riding by, both to no avail.

A glint of light caught her eyes, off the road and into the bushes painted wildfire by the dusking sky. Old folk tales of feys and wisps warn her to ignore these signs, but hunger champions over rationale in hard times.

She is greeted with a serene meadow, hidden behind branches and vines, seemingly otherworldly compared to the drought and famine without. She can hear the singing and chiming of insects and birds - like a midsummer night's dream in the girl's distant memories.

The glint greets her silently. Standing in the middle of the meadow is a shard of quaint, azure crystals, glowing and pulsing gently. This might fetch a good price, the girl thinks. She reaches out to the shard, sending a prayer to the stars.

And then there is falling. She opens her eyes to an infinite expanse of space, filled with brilliant colors.

She sees father and brother bent down in the fields, hands scraped and scarred from all the extra farm work that yet yields no fruit; she sees the royal collectors, holding that scepter to block away pleading hands, while their soldiers load baskets of rice and grain onto the carriage; she glances oceans of flame, howling like a thousand wolves, burning down forests and groves in the far hills.

The girl cannot avert her eyes.

She watches as fires burn and fade, lights come and go, days fly past, years went by. She sees the ancestors peek out from their hiding caves, hoping that danger has diverted its attention for now; she sees strange men and women, dressed in absurd garments, playing witchcrafts dwarfing her wildest imaginations; she hears the cackling and snickering of shadows, shapeless without form, laughing from behind the veil at this world she hates yet holds dear.

Then she sees herself, walking though time and tide, off the high roads, into the meadow, putting her hand onto that shard of brilliant light, again and again.

And then there is nothing at all. Her hand feels only cold autumn wind. The shard is no where to be found. It was but a moments' passing, a midsummer night's dream.

She feels as if she has come to know this world, yet without any strand of comprehension.
