## Myriad

The famine has ravaged her family, her fields, and her grumbling stomach. The girl shambles along the high road running next to the village, scrounging desperately for scraps of grain, calling out to the noble carriages riding by, both to no avail.

A glint of light caught her eyes, off the road and into the bushes painted wildfire by the dusking sky. Old folk tales of feys and wisps warn her to ignore these signs, but hunger champions over rationale in hard times.

She is greeted with a serene meadow, hidden behind branches and vines, seemingly otherworldly compared to the drought and famine without. She can hear the singing and chiming of insects and birds - like a midsummer night's dream in the girl's distant memories.

The glint greets her silently. Standing in the middle of the meadow is a shard of quaint, azure crystals, glowing and pulsing gently. This might fetch a good price, the girl thinks. She reaches out to the shard, sending a prayer to the stars.

And then there is falling. She opens her eyes to an infinite expanse of space, filled with brilliant colors.

She sees father and brother bent down in the fields, hands scraped and scarred from all the extra farm work that yet yields no fruit; she sees the royal collectors, holding that scepter to block away pleading hands, while their soldiers load baskets of rice and grain onto the carriage; she glances oceans of flame, howling like a thousand wolves, burning down forests and groves in the far hills.

The girl cannot avert her eyes.

She watches as fires burn and fade, lights come and go, days fly past, years went by. She sees the ancestors peek out from their hiding caves, hoping that danger has diverted its attention for now; she sees strange men and women, dressed in absurd garments, playing witchcrafts dwarfing her wildest imaginations; she hears the cackling and snickering of shadows, shapeless without form, laughing from behind the veil at this world she hates yet holds dear.

Then she sees herself, walking though time and tide, off the high roads, into the meadow, putting her hand onto that shard of brilliant light, again and again.

And then there is nothing at all. Her hand feels only cold autumn wind. The shard is no where to be found. It was but a moments' passing, a midsummer night's dream.

She feels as if she has come to know this world, yet without any strand of comprehension.

## The Void

"Cardinal to Nest, I am at the quarry, descending in thirty seconds, over."

Without waiting for a reply, the man shuts down his transmitter, jams it into his jacket pocket, and rappels down the wall of this building. The midnight glory of Barohaven high above from the upper floors does not illuminate this part of the Midtown, nor the sewer houses further below. He is well-accustomed to these environments, however - the ace detective of the Investigation Bureau have too many cases on his belt to be fazed by simple darkness and some depravity. 

And he just want to finish this case quickly and go back to home.

Descending in silence, with only the light, unperceived tapping of his foot on the bleached brick walls, Cardinal lets his thought loose for a moment. Rap, tap, tap. How many times had he done so over the past years, hanging on by a thread between life and death, between heaven and hell? Rap, tap, tap. These reckless ventures feel routine to him at the current point, like chores on a Tuesday afternoon.

Rap, tap, tap. Fourty-seven, fourty-six, fourty-five. The tappings halt along with the descent - this should be where the cult hideout is operating from. The detective flips his wrist, locking the mounted pulley mechanism in place, and with his other hand pulls out the shock pistol from the holster. 

Quiet chantings leak through the shut curtains behind the window besides him, oblivious of what is about to strike.
> *"Omnia nihil, omnia licent."*
> 
> *"Omnia nihil, omnia licent."*

"Is that so..." Cardinal lets out a long sigh. Maybe this time, these cultists are onto something after all. Sometimes it does feel like what they said. Time and time again he struggles to find some dose of adrenaline from these works, as he did in ample amount in greener times; nowadays, there's only an infinite expanse of void where his burning beating heart once was.

He shakes off the irrelevant thoughts. Repelling off the walls, Cardinal swings quickly towards the window. The glass panels shatter immediately as the kick impacts the frame; The detective lands just beside the podium. With a quick shot of his pistol driven solely by instincts, the masked figure leading the chant falls to the ground, body spasming and speech slurred by the sudden shock.

The quiet, ordered chanting comes to a sudden halt from the interruption, and a few exacerbated gasps that follow. Raising up his free hand, Cardinal opens up his holo-shield, anticipating the barrage of bolts and missiles that will assault him quickly, as per routine.

However, only silence follows this time. His eyes sweeps across the room in surprise; Behind the holographic membrane protecting him from nothing, couple dozens of masks watch him quietly. Featureless, smooth, a perfectly cut opal without defect, void of content. These masks make him uncomfortable.

"Hmph. No welcome party? That's a first." He mumbles. Keeping his shielded stance intact, Cardinal flicks up the pendant that fell to the ground with the masked speaker, catching it with his pistol hand. "This is the piece, hmm?" The detective examines the onyx on the pendant quickly, before turning to the silent cultists below the podium stage, "Now scram, all of you, before I change my-"

"Halt... you-... take not..." A few words struggle to jump in between the tremblings behind the mask of the speaker. Cardinal looks to the side, down at the electrocuted cultist.

"Oh shut it. What is this to you anyways, or your meaningless worships? Isn't it as you said, that *all is void, all is-*"

Something trembles in his heart. The detective drops what he is holding, and reaches for his face. His touch is greeted by sweet nothingness - all his fingertips feel are just a featureless, smooth sensation.

Falling to the ground, the man scrambles to pick up the pendant again. He doesn't know since when, but in the reflection within the onyx gemstone, his face has donned the perfectly cut mask as well.

## Apotheosis

Come, little one! You have finally reached upon our court! We have patiently awaited your arrival.

Look down at this world that you once resided in... Sundered, shattered, piece by piece reduced to mass and shape, much like those that came before yours. At this end of time, it is ready for a grander purpose - to be reshaped into perfection, in your image.

And your image alone shall populate our new realm as the exemplar, little one. We have watched your journey over seven million cycles. We watched as you rose up from the mud, taking on a greater aspiration; We watched as you lit your fire, harnessing our greatest gift; We watched as you bathed in ancient lights, inspired to reshape the fabrics with these powers; We watched as your hands touched the beacon, ready to ascend to a perfect meridian.

Now, you stand upon our court. The meridian draws nigh. Come see, little one! Come see how we shape your image into reality!

Take these mass that are distilled from the remains. It possesses weight and emanates presence. It is the Body of our new exemplar. Body is simple, featureless, without sophistication, but it is the fundamental of your being, that gives physical frames to greater purposes.

We can shape the Body into different forms, to grant them design. It is intangible compared to mass, and we have to capture it very delicately. Look at it - do you see yourself in this creation? Design is complex, yet it allows purposes into the Body, attaching strings to the joints, the limbs, that moves the body into a dance. This is Will. Will drives the silent into motion.

Our exemplar remains without a pilot, something to puppeteer the strings. This will do - a Soul. You may recognize this! We planted the same seed seven million cycles ago, whose fruit you have brought back to our court. Now, look around you - the tiny wisps dancing and weaving around us are all your kin.

Little one, it is done! The union of Body and Soul, joined together by the bridge of Will, is the exemplar made in your image. When they finally visit our new world, they shall see a lack of imperfection, and exhaustion of potential - what we have all failed to find in many other stars.

And to them we can offer your image, for them to write their own stories.

... Yet we see your eyes fixated on something else that we cannot see. We have watched you standing beside others that left before you, with that same light in your eyes. We are familiar with this matter, yet we cannot understand it like you do. What you described as Emotion... Is it missing from the equation?

Perhaps we have failed to distill and filter out these impurities from this world's substances. It is not too late, however, little one, to let go of this Emotion. In our perfect world, it is of no use to us and our exemplars.

...

We see. It is a request we cannot grant you, however. Our exemplar cannot be compound and impure. Is it really what you seek to be cast back into the maelstrom?

If you insist, we will return you to the fractured world, little one. You will be reduced to your primordial components, to be made whole again in another image, without the impurities that have failed us before.

Good night, little one. We wait patiently for your return, seven million cycles later.

## Plethora

Many years later, as he finally faces the guillotine, Elder Prince Pilou is to remember that distant afternoon when father first took him and Solian on the victory parade.

Father had just quelled the Haarkien invasion in the south-east of the Kingdom. He was given a hero's welcome back at the capitol, hailed as great King that protected his lands from the barbaric raiders. Hundreds and thousands of commoners, peasants, and noblemen alike lined the streets to his palace, cheering at the lavishly golden caravan draped in velvet, pulled by white stallions.

At that time he was still a young child, watching the deeper meanings of the world unfold with childishly innocent eyes, together with his brother Solian. He would point at objects on display in the palace, asking about their names, and be amazed at how beautiful they are.

It was for this reason that father brought him along on his most recent crusade, put into the care of his loyal chamberlain, as he led the march, riding into enemy lines side by side with his soldiers.

There, he watched from atop the lookout tower, as father and his steed rode in formation with his soldiers and companions. His sword cleaved down enemies, while the knights and squires protected him from flanking arrows. At once a stray raider broke through the front line and charged towards the king, ready to stab a scimitar into his chest; he was quickly intercepted by soldiers, crying out to alert their king, rushing in to block the path with their own bodies.

The chamberlain gasped, but Pilou only giggled excitedly at the scene.

As the golden carriages rode back into the palace surrounded by blaring trumpets and cheers, father patted him on the head, and asked: "The people hail me as a great king, Pilou. Why do you think that is?"

Pilou thought for long. "You are kind to them, and treat everyone like friends. They admire your valor, and would follow you to the world's end. With companions like these, you shall prosper forever."

The king nodded thoughtfully. 

In the following years, under his father's instruction, Pilou learned to lead in both the court and the battlefield. He grew up to be a king beloved by all just like his father, and led many battles, including the war against his own brother.

It is all for naught, of course, when the Third Kingdom came to wage war against his land, and he chose, perhaps foolishly, to defend his hold and his people to the last second.

## Solipsis

Many years later, as he finally faces the guillotine, Younger Prince Solian is to remember that distant afternoon when father first took him and Pilou on the victory parade.

Father had just quelled the Haarkien invasion in the south-east of the Kingdom. He was given a hero's welcome back at the capitol, hailed as great King that conquered his enemies who wanted a piece of his land. Hundreds and thousands of commoners, subjects, and peons alike lined the streets to his palace, admiring at his lavishly golden caravan draped in velvet, pulled by white stallions.

At that time he was still a young child, yet he had already started to see the world folding into a singularity, much unlike his brother Pilou. He would point at objects on display in the palace, and look away in disappointment after learning their names, and what they are.

It was for this reason that father brought him along on his most recent crusade, put into the care of his faithful chamberlain, as he led the march, riding into enemy lines followed by his soldiers.

There, he watched from atop the lookout tower, as father and his steed spearheads the charge into enemy lines. His sword cleaved down enemies, using his followers and squires as shields against the dangers from behind. At once a lapse in the formation let a stray raider through, who charges the king with blood in his eyes; With quick reflexes and swift orders, Father rotated his guard to block the offense, giving him time to raise his sword and chop the mongrel's head clean off.

The chamberlain gasped, but Solian only chuckled amusedly at the scene.

As the golden carriages rode back into the palace surrounded by blaring trumpets and cheers, father patted him on the head, and asked: "The people hail me as a great king, Solian. Why do you think that is?"

Solian answered without hesitation. "You are a powerful king, capable of conquering any enemy. They fear your glory, and have no choice but to follow you to the world's end. With such strengths that you have, no one shall ever defeat you."

The king nodded thoughtfully. 

In the following years, under his father's instruction, Solian honed his skills in both the training ground and the archives. He grew up to be a king feared by all just like his father, and fought many battles, including the war against his own brother.

It is all for naught, of course, when the Third Kingdom came to wage war against his land, and his subjects chose, perhaps foolishly, to open the gates on the first night of the siege.
