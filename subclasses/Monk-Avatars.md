# Monk - Way of the Yolkateomeh (Night Avatars)

The tribespeople of [Yharn](../region/Yharn) finds worship in the Nocturne Parade that stalks the jungle at night, learning what they can from the hostile nature that is indifferent to their plight. Beyond their collective worship of [Xbeltz'aloc](../religion/patronus/Xbeltz'aloc) the Night Crawler, Yharnic tribals pay respect to deified animalistic entities known as **Yolkateomeh**, or Night Avatars. Way of the Yolkateomeh is the practice of honing one's body to the greater will of the Yharnic jungle as a whole, fighting with the ferocity, agility, and shrewdness of the Night Avatars.

<span style="color:#FF0000">While the tribespeople of [Yharn](../region/Yharn) accepts the Night Avatars' influence willingly, there are those who fall victim to [Xbeltz'aloc](../religion/patronus/Xbeltz'aloc)'s curse, obtaining such power against their will. For them, Way of the Yolkateomeh takes on an appearance that is less animalistic, and instead more eldritch and horrific, in the form of aberrant blood and warped flesh. </span>
