# Fighter - Sulphuric Militant

Between the suffocating smoke and the smell of sulphur and death on the battlefield stands stalwartly a machine of slaughter, striking fear into those fortunate enough to survive the onslaught. As a specialist in close-quarter firearm combat, you prefer to be up close and personal with these sweet contraptions, challenge your foes head-on, and punish the cowardice of those who hesitates for the tiniest moment.

## Slayer Training

When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in (exotic) firearms and Intimidation.

## Power over Finesse

Starting at 3rd level, you learn to utilize your strength to stabilize yourself in close quarter combat. While attacking with firearms with the Point-Blank property, you may use your Strength modifier instead of Dexterity modifier for your attack rolls, and may add your ability modifier to the damage.

## Cull the Weak

Starting at 3rd level, whenever you attack a creature within 5 ft of you with 10 or less hitpoints as part of an Attack action, you may instead subject it to a Dexterity saving throw. The DC of this saving throw is equal to your Culling DC, calculated as 8 + Prof + StrMod. On fail, the creature is reduced to 0 hitpoints, and you gain temporary hitpoints equal to half of the reduced amount.

The culling threshold for execution increases to 20 at 10th level and 30 at 18th level.

## Battle Adrenaline

Starting at 7th level, whenever an enemy fails a save against your Culling DC, you gain the positive effects of Haste until the start of your next turn.

## Brutal Execution

Starting at 10th level, you have advantage on attacks with a point-blank firearm against prone enemies. Prone enemies have disadvantage on saving throws against your Culling DC.

## Challenge the Prey

Starting at 15th level, you may forego one of the attacks with your Attack action to attempt to challenge an enemy above your culling threshold, and force them to make a Dexterity saving throw against your Culling DC. If they fail, you gain 15 temporary hitpoints.

You may use this feature a number of times equal to your Strength modifier per long rest.

## Punish the Fear

Starting at 18th level, whenever you are wielding a point-blank firearm, enemies within your range moving away from you trigger attacks of opportunity from you.
