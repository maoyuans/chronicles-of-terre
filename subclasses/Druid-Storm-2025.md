# Druid - Circle of the Storm

Wind, rain, and storm are the most primal and ferocious aspect of nature. Druids worshipping this aspect embodies the unrefined and unpredictable prowess of the storm and the sea within them.

## Tempest's Blessing

As a worshipper of storms, you are bestowed with control over this aspect of nature. When you reach certain levels in this class, you gain access to the following spells, and thereafter always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, it is nonetheless a druid spell for you.
- 2nd: Fog Cloud, Thunderwave
- 3rd: Gust of Wind, Shatter
- 5th: Call Lightning, Lightning Bolt
- 7th: Ice Storm, Storm Sphere
- 9th: Control Winds, Maelstrom

## Eye of the Storm

Starting at 2nd level, you learn to gather a swirling storm around yourself that lashes out at enemies. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon a miniature storm above you. The storm follows your movement and pours light rain down in a 10 ft radius around you, extinguishing all exposed flames and granting you resistance to fire damage, and lasts for 1 minute, until you fall unconscious, or until you dismiss it (no action required).

Additionally, while the storm is active, you can as a bonus action call down a minor bolt of lightning, dealing 1d6 lightning damage to a creature within 30 ft of you.

## Master of the Wind

Starting at 6th level, your magics are imbued with a mighty wind that knocks your enemies off their feet. Once per turn when you deal damage to a large of smaller creature with your spells or your Eye of the Storm feature, you may choose to summon a gust of wind and subject them to a Strength saving throw against your druid spellcasting DC. On a fail, the creature is pushed up to 10 ft in any direction and knocked prone.

## Vengeful Reach

Starting at 10th level, the storms you summon brew with a vengeful rage. The lightning bolts you summon with your Eye of the Storm feature improves to dealing 1d6 lightning and 1d6 thunder damage. 

Starting at 6th level, whenever you cast a spell that deals thunder or lightning damage, you can choose another enemy within 30 feet of you that was not the damaged by the spell. That enemy is struck by a minor bolt of storm, dealing 1d6 lightning and 1d6 thunder damage to them. 

## Ocean's Grace

Starting at 10th level, you gain the following benefits:
- You can walk on water as if it is solid ground.
- You can breathe underwater.
- You gain a swim speed equal to your walking speed.
- You can calm a naturally occurring storm to a lower intensity or cause it to dissipate.
- Whenever you cast the Call Lightning spell while it is raining or out at sea, it is cast at one level higher than the spell slot you consumed.
