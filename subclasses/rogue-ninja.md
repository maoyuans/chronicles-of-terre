# Rogue - Ninja

## Quick Draw

Starting at 3rd level, you can draw your weapon for free as part of a thrown attack with it. 

## Precise Throwing

Starting at 3rd level, attacking at long range with a thrown weapon no longer imposes disadvantage. Thrown attacks against targets within your normal range have +1 to damage rolls.

## Weight Training

Starting at 9th level, you may draw and attack with two thrown weapons as a single attack action. 

## Blinking Disengage

Starting at 9th level, whenever you disengage, you may instead teleport to an empty space you can see within 30 ft, consuming your movement according to shortest distance.

## Fan of Knives

Starting at 13rd level, whenever you attack a target with a thrown weapon, you may make extra attacks against any other target within 10 ft of the original target. You must throw a weapon against each target.
