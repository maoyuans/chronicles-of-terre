# Rogue - Gregorian

## Utilitarian Faith

When you take this architype at 3rd level, choose a Deity to serve and one of their domains to follow. You may change this Deity and domain once per level up. In addition, you can cast a 1st level spell provided by your chosen domain's spells. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

At 5th level, you can also cast a 2nd level spell provided by your chosen domain's spells. At 7th level, you can also cast a 3rd level spell provided by your chosen domain's spells. At 9th level, you can also cast a 4th level spell provided by your chosen domain's spells.

Spells cast by this feature can only be cast at their lowest level.

## Sectless Belief

Starting at 3rd level, you may use the channel divinity class feature of your chosen domain as a cleric of equal level to your levels in rogue. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Service to Divinity

At 9th level, you gain proficiency in Religion. If you are already proficient in Religion, you gain expertise in Religion. 

Additionally, you may change your chosen domain at the end of a long rest, as long as your chosen deity has dominion over it as well.

## Dogmatic Dillitante

At 13th level, you gain an additional use of your channel divinity class feature. Moreover, you can now use any channel divinity from any domain that your deity has dominion over.
