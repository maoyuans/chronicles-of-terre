# Bard - College of Jest

The most hurting of words often come from the most comedic and lighthearted of characters. While others of their kind tend to travel the roads singing tunes and telling tales, of heroes, sages, and the like, jesters, bards studying the college of Jest, make a living from deprecation of both others and themselves. They know best the true power of one's sense of self-worth, and as such their mockery is deep cutting and destructive.

## Scarring Mockery

Starting at 3rd level, the **Vicious Mockery** cantrip is empowered for you, and you learn it if you did not know it already. The base damage die of the Vicious Mockery cantrip is now 1d8, and all scaling uses this die as well. This mockery can be empowered further by expending one use of your Bardic Inspiration to roll the die and add the number rolled as extra damage to the cantrip. 

## Gallows Humor

Starting at 3rd level, whenever you take damage from an attack, you can choose to mock yourself, adding 1d8 psychic damage to the damage roll. If you do, you can heal an ally within 30 feet for the total damage you take from the attack. This can be used a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus and replenishes on a short or long rest. 

## Taunting Mockery

Starting at 6th level, whenever an enemy fails a saving throw against your Vicious Mockery cantrip, if that enemy's next attack before the end of its next turn is against an ally instead of you, it must make a saving throw against your Vicious Mockery cantrip again. If it fails, the target's attack deals half damage. 

## Last Laugh

Starting at 14th level, whenever you are reduced to 0 hit points by an enemy, you can laugh as loud as you are able and expend all of your remaining uses of Bardic Inspiration. Roll the dice and add them together. The total is added to the next damage roll for all of your allies that can see and hear you. If the enemy that defeated you is themselves defeated within 1 round of you using this ability, you are healed for an amount of hit points equal to the total rolled. Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.
