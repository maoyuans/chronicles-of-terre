# Fighter - Battle Herald

*The Battle Herald archetype was remade on 07/19/2025. To view the legacy version, see [Battle Herald (2021)](Fighter-Herald-old).*

Even the clashes and screams on the battlefield cannot drown out your inspiring presence as a herald of battle. You know best how to inspire and motivate your companions within the chaos, rallying, commanding, and invigorating them, fueling their purpose.

## Rallying Cry

Starting at 3rd level, you learn how to inspire your allies to fight on past their injuries. When you use your Second Wind class feature to recover hit points, all allies that can see or hear you within 30 feet gain temporary hit points equal to the amount recovered. 

## Expanded Tactics

When you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you learn other methods to deal with conflict. You gain proficiency with Persuasion and Performance. 

## Morale Support

Starting at 7th level, words of encouragement flow from you naturally, granting your allies a boost in confidence. Whenever an ally you can see within 30 ft of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you may use your reaction to add 1d8 to the roll. You may choose to do so after the roll, but before the result is revealed. A creature cannot benefit from this feature and Bardic Inspiration at the same time.

You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses on a long rest.

## Inspiring Surge

Starting at 10th level, your orders inspire in your allies a surge of power. When you use your Action Surge class feature, you can choose a number of allies equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) within 30 feet of you. The chosen allies can make one melee or ranged weapon attack with their reaction, provided that they can see or hear you. 

## Ready to Strike

Starting at 15th level, you stand ready for the upcoming battle together with your friends. Whenever initiative is rolled, you may choose to activate your Second Wind feature. If you do so, you and all affected allies gain advantage on this initiative roll.

## Divinely Favored

Starting at 18th level, your presence on the battlefield earns you the favor of even the gods of war and battle. While an ally has temporary hit points granted by your Rallying Cry feature, they are affected by the Bless spell.
