# Wizard - Siege Wizardry

While many wizards prefer to practice the arts of arcane and elements, some serving in the military took a more practical approach, utilizing sharpened steel, magically launched at high velocity, to tear apart enemy defenses with high efficiency. Siege wizards have been stationed on the High Wall of Bladefall since its construction, and have contributed to its defense with their martial and arcane practices.

## Kinetic Manipulation

When you choose the arcane tradition of siege wizardry at 2nd level, you learn to infuse inanimate weapons with overwhelming kinetic energy and launch them at high speed towards your enemies. You learn the **Iron Bolt** cantrip.

**Iron Bolt**
- Evocation Cantrip
- Casting Time: 1 action
- Range: 120 ft
- Components: V, S, M (A piece of unattended ammunition of light weapon)
- Duration: Instantaneous
You hurl a piece of unattended ammunition or a light weapon at a target. Make a ranged spell attack against the target, dealing 1d10 damage of the physical damage type of the launched object. Ammunition is destroyed as normal if fired by this spell. Modifiers to damage rolls of the launched object also apply to this spell.

The spellâ€™s damage increases by 1d10 when you reach 5th level (2d10), 11th level (3d10) and 17th level (4d10).

Additionally, you may expend a spell slot when casting this spell. If you do, you may launch an additional number of objects equal to the level of the spell slot expended. Make a separate attack roll for each object.

## Combat Artillery

Starting at 2th level, at the end of your turn, if you did not move, you gain +1 to AC. This continues to stack up to your intelligence modifier. This bonus is lost if you are moved in any way.

## Opportune Strike

Starting at 6th level, whenever you cast Iron Bolt, you may specify a trigger for each object to be launched. Before the start of your next turn, the corresponding object will launch automatically when triggered, as if cast by a readied action, but does not consume your reaction. If not triggered at the start of your next turn, the object loses its potency.

## Shattering Impact

Starting at 6th level, your spells deal maximum damage to objects and constructs.

## Bolt Recall

Starting at 10th level, whenever you cast Iron Bolt, you may expend your bonus action to recall a launched object to your hand. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per short rest.

## Precise Artillery

Starting at 10th level, Combat Artillery also grants +1 to spell attack bonus per stack.

## Heightened Artillery

Starting at 14th level, Combat Artillery also grants +1 to spell save DC.
