# Cleric - Tyranny Domain

Domination arises in every form imaginable, not just in hearts full of destruction and chaos. These are the masters who arrange things to ensure that whatever happens, they always win. Know that there is no cost too great for glory. 

## Domain Spells

At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.
- 1st: Command, Bane;
- 3rd: Enthrall, Ray of Enfeeblement;
- 5th: Hunger of Hadar, Conjure Barrage;
- 7th: Blight, Shadow of Moil;
- 9th: Dance Macabre, Dominate Person.

## With an Iron Fist

You gain proficiency with heavy armor and deal 1 extra damage with unarmed strikes while wearing heavy armor.

## Taskmaster

Starting at 1st level, as an action you can coerce allies to comply with your orders, and for enemies to think twice about attacking you. Choose a number of enemies up to half your proficiency bonus within 60 ft that you can see. Your allies have advantage on attack rolls against the chosen enemies, but disadvantage on attack rolls against all other creatures until the end of their next turn. The chosen enemies have disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of their next turn. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain these uses after a long rest. 

## Channel Divinity: Demand Tribute

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to rightfully take what is yours from the unworthy. As an action, you present your holy symbol, dominating over another creature within 30 ft. When the affected creature would gain advantage on an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check, you may choose to demand tribute from them. They lose that advantage, and you gain advantage the next time you make a check of the same type.

You can only use this feature once on the same creature, twice when you reach 6th level, and thrice when you reach 18th level.

## Oppressing Faith

Starting at 6th level, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Furthermore, creatures affected by Taskmaster have disadvantage on their saves against your spells and other domain abilities. 

## Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
