# Cleric - Tyranny Domain

Domination arises in every form imaginable, not just in hearts full of destruction and chaos. These are the masters who arrange things to ensure that whatever happens, they always win in the end. Know that there is no cost too great for glory. 

## Domain Spells

At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.
- 1st: Command, Bane;
- 3rd: Enthrall, Ray of Enfeeblement;
- 5th: Hunger of Hadar, Conjure Barrage;
- 7th: Blight, Shadow of Moil;
- 9th: Dance Macabre, Dominate Person.

## With an Iron Fist

You gain proficiency with heavy armor and deal 1 extra damage with unarmed strikes while wearing heavy armor.

## Taskmaster

Starting at 1st level, as an action you can coerce allies to comply with your orders, and for enemies to think twice about attacking you. Choose a number of enemies up to half your proficiency bonus within 60 ft that you can see. Your allies have advantage on attack rolls against the chosen enemies, but disadvantage on attack rolls against all other creatures until the end of their next turn. The chosen enemies have disadvantage on attack rolls against you until the end of their next turn. You may use this ability a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and regain these uses after a long rest. 

## Channel Divinity: Demand Tribute

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to rightfully take what is yours from the unworthy. As a reaction when another creature within 30 ft of you makes an attack roll, saving throw, or ability check with advantage, you may present your holy symbol to dominate over it, and take this advantage as a tribute. The creature loses advantage on that roll, and you gain advantage on your next roll of the same type.

## Oppressing Faith

Starting at 6th level, you have advantage on Charisma (Intimidation) checks. Furthermore, creatures affected by Taskmaster have disadvantage on their saves against your spells and other domain abilities. 

## Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
