# Cleric - Chaos Domain

The swirling random events may seem happenstance to some, luck to others, but you know the truth, it is a force, a deadly, invigorating force behind these occurrences. The power of Chaos does not reveal itself to many, but those with the will to see it, can harness its great power. 

## Domain Spells

At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.
- 1st: Chaos Bolt, Tasha's Hideous Laughter;
- 3rd: Crown of Madness, Scorching Ray;
- 5th: Blink, Enemies Abound;
- 7th: Confusion, Polymorph;
- 9th: Maelstrom, Synaptic Static.

## Eldritch Cantrip

You gain Eldritch Blast as a bonus cantrip. For you, this counts as a Cleric cantrip, with Wisdom as your spellcasting ability. 

## Magical Pandemonium

When you choose this domain at 1st level, the magical energy you wield becomes unpredictable. As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot of any level to cast a random spell (from any spell list) with base level equal to the slot expended. You do not choose the spell cast, but you may choose how the spell is cast.

## Channel Divinity: Chaos Pulse

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity class feature to incite chaos. When you hit a creature with Chaos Bolt, you can use Channel Divinity to trigger its leaping effect once, plus one additional time per level of the spell slot expended.

## Gift of Misfortune

Starting at 6th level, whenever you have disadvantage on a spell attack roll, your damage is maximized for the associated spell. 

## Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
