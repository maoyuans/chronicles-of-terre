# Cleric - Chaos Domain

Throughout history, those in positions of power and greatness have once and again proclaimed themselves as paragons of order and unity; yet as time pushes on, the inevitable entropy will wash over the balance they have sought to create without exception. While this swirling maelstrom of randomness that permeates in every corner and moment of our daily lives may seem happenstance to some and luck to others, some may know it as a deadly force - Chaos. This power does not reveal itself to many willingly, but those with the keen eyes and strong wills to see it can harness its kaleidoscopic power.

## Domain Spells

At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.
- 1st: Chaos Bolt, Tasha's Hideous Laughter;
- 3rd: Crown of Madness, Scorching Ray;
- 5th: Blink, Enemies Abound;
- 7th: Confusion, Polymorph;
- 9th: Maelstrom, Synaptic Static.

## Eldritch Gift

You gain Eldritch Blast as a bonus cantrip. For you, this counts as a Cleric cantrip, with Wisdom as your spellcasting ability. 

## Sorcerous Gift

*Alternative feature for clerics using 24' rules.*

You gain Sorcerous Burst as a bonus cantrip. For you, this counts as a Cleric cantrip, with Wisdom as your spellcasting ability. 

## Magical Pandemonium

When you choose this domain at 1st level, the magical energy you wield becomes unpredictable. As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot of any level to cast a random eligible spell (from any spell list) with base level equal to the slot expended. You do not choose the spell cast, but you may choose how the spell is cast. For a spell to be eligible, it must have a cast time of an action or a bonus action, and must not consume material components.

## Channel Divinity: Chaos Pulse

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity class feature to incite chaos. When you hit a creature with Chaos Bolt, you can use Channel Divinity to trigger its leaping effect once, plus one additional time per level of the spell slot expended.

## Gift of Misfortune

Starting at 6th level, whenever you have disadvantage on an attack roll, your damage is rolled with advantage for the associated attack. 

## Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip. 

## Chaos Ultimatum

Starting at 17th level, your presence alone can alter the fate of others, adding uncertainty to what would seem like destined success. Whenever a creature within 60 ft of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you may as a reaction impose absolute disadvantage on the roll.
