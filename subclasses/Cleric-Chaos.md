# Cleric - Chaos Domain

The swirling random events may seem happenstance to some, luck to others, but you know the truth, it is a force, a deadly, invigorating force behind these occurrences. The power of Chaos does not reveal itself to many, but those with the will to see it, can harness its great power. 

## Domain Spells

At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.
- 1st: Chaos Bolt, Tasha's Hideous Laughter;
- 3rd: Crown of Madness, Scorching Ray;
- 5th: Blink, Enemies Abound;
- 7th: Confusion, Polymorph;
- 9th: Maelstrom, Synaptic Static.

## Eldritch Gift

You gain Eldritch Blast as a bonus cantrip. For you, this counts as a Cleric cantrip, with Wisdom as your spellcasting ability. 

## Magical Pandemonium

When you choose this domain at 1st level, the magical energy you wield becomes unpredictable. As a bonus action, you can expend a spell slot of any level to cast a random eligible spell (from any spell list) with base level equal to the slot expended. You do not choose the spell cast, but you may choose how the spell is cast. For a spell to be eligible, it must have a cast time of an action or a bonus action, and must not consume material components.

## Channel Divinity: Chaos Pulse

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity class feature to incite chaos. When you hit a creature with Chaos Bolt, you can use Channel Divinity to trigger its leaping effect once, plus one additional time per level of the spell slot expended.

## Gift of Misfortune

Starting at 6th level, whenever you have disadvantage on an attack roll, your damage is rolled with advantage for the associated attack. 

## Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip. 

## Chaos Ultimatum

Starting at 17th level, your presence alone can alter the fate of others, adding uncertainty to what would seem like destined success. Whenever a creature within 60 ft of you makes an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you may as a reaction impose absolute disadvantage on the roll.
