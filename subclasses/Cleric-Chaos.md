# Cleric - Chaos Domain

The swirling random events may seem happenstance to some, luck to others, but you know the truth, it is a force, a deadly, invigorating force behind these occurrences. The power of Chaos does not reveal itself to many, but those with the will to see it, can harness its great power. 

## Domain Spells

At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.
- 1st: Chaos Bolt, Tasha's Hideous Laughter;
- 3rd: Phantasmal Force, Crown of Madness;
- 5th: Enemies Abound, Summon Lesser Demons;
- 7th: Confusion, Compulsion;
- 9th: Insect Plague, Synaptic Static.

## Eldritch Cantrip

You gain Eldritch Blast as a bonus cantrip. For you, this counts as a Cleric cantrip. 

## Improved Chaos Bolt

Whenever you trigger the leap effect from Chaos Bolt, it leaps twice and each bolt does an additional 1d6 points of damage. 

## Channel Divinity: Chaos Pulse

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity class feature to blast a wave of chaotic energy. When an enemy within 30ft attacks you, you may as a reaction, impose disadvantage on their attack rolls until the start of your next turn. In addition, the next Chaos Bolt you cast within one minute that targets this creature automatically triggers it's leaping effect. 

## Gift of Misfortune

Starting at 6th level, whenever you have disadvantage on a spell attack roll, your damage is maximized for the associated spell. 

## Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
