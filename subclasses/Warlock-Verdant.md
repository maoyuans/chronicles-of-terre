# Warlock - Pact of the Verdant

While the teachings of druidism tells of drawing life forces and energies from the branches and streams of the leyline flowing throughout the earth, some practitioners of druidic magic are gifted with boons from the [Viridian Grove](../region/Verza#viridian-grove) itself, the great fairy oak that mothers all of the druidic leylines of Terre. With verdant blessings in hand, these spellcasters harnesses life and nature around them to hinder their foes and heal their allies.

***Pact Theme.*** The Pact of the Verdant is centered around nature, both the life and the decay of it. Spellcastings and magics of this pact manifests around such concepts - the Eldritch Blast cantrip, for example, can take forms of a spectral wood spike or a thorn whip, while the Arms of Hadar invokes thorn and vine tentacles to assault nearby enemies.

## Expanded Spell List

The great fairy oak blesses you with an expanded knowledge of the ways of nature. You learn the *Druidcraft* cantrip, and the following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.
- 1st: Entangle, Faerie Fire
- 2nd: Barkskin, Spike Growth
- 3rd: Erupting Earth, Plant Growth
- 4th: Grasping Vine, Guardian of Nature
- 5th: Contagion, Wrath of Nature

## Seed of Hexation

Starting at 1st level, you can call upon the Grove to plant a sapping hex upon an enemy. As a bonus action, choose one creature you can see within 60 ft of you. The target is hexed for 1 minute. The hex ends early if the target dies, you die, or you are incapacitated. 

While hexed, the creature suffers from the following detriments:
- The hexed creature's movement speed is decreased by 10 ft.
- Whenever the hexed creature takes an Action, it takes 1d4 poison damage.
- Whenever the hexed creature makes a Constitution saving throw, it must roll a d4, and substract the number rolled from the saving throw.

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a short or long rest.

## Leeching Hex

Starting at 6th level, the hexes you plant pulses outward with each beat of the victim's heart, sending a wave of life towards your allies. Whenever the target hexed by your Seed of Hexation takes an action, all creatures of your choice within 15 ft of the hexed creature recovers 1d4 hitpoints.
