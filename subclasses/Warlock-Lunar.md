# Warlock - Pact of the Lunar

The moon is a mysterious force. It safeguards the people from the terror of darkness within the night, yet it leads out as well the most lunatic side of the deranged and the desperate. You have been chosen by this entity to serve as its representative and carry out its will, and in return it protects you from harm with pure, flowing moonlight.

## Expanded Spell List

The Lunar lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell. The following spells are added to the warlock spell list for you.
- 1st: Guiding Bolt, Sleep
- 2nd: Darkvision, Moonbeam
- 3rd: Catnap, Melf's Minute Meteors
- 4th: Freedom of Movement, Phantasmal Killer
- 5th: Commune with Nature, Wall of Force

## Blessing of the Moon

At 1st level, you learn the Light and Sacred Flame cantrips, they count as Warlock cantrips for you, but donâ€™t count against your number of Cantrips known. 

## Lunar Armor

At 1st level, the moon blesses you with the ability to conjure a spectral armor made of moonlight and stardust if you are not wearing any physical armor. This armor functions as the spell Mage Armor, setting your AC to 13 + DexMod. 

## Call to the Moon

Starting at 1st level, as a bonus action, you can call down moonlight to shine upon and strengthen your Lunar Armor. Until the end of your next turn, your AC is set to 13 + ChaMod instead. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

## Rebuke of the Night

Starting at 6th level, while Lunar Armor is active, you gain the ability to lash out at enemies with radiant damage. You have a pool of d6s that you spend to fuel this ability. The number of dice in the pool equals 1 + your warlock level. 

As a reaction, whenever a creature you can see within 60 ft of you damages you, you may lash out at them using radiant damage, spending dice from the pool. The maximum number of dice you can spend at once equals your proficiency bonus. Roll the dice you spend and add them together to determine the total amount of damage.

Your pool regains all expended dice when you finish a long rest. 

## Nocturnal Grace

Starting at 10th level, whenever you use your Call to the Moon feature, the moonlight also covers a 60 ft radius area around you. For the duration, this area moves with you and is considered in dim light. Creatures within the area cannot benefit from invisibility and loses all resistance to radiant damage. Shapeshifters within the area are temporarily reverted to their true form.

## Lunar Aegis

Starting at 14th level, your Lunar Armor absorbs the essense of those who attacks you. Whenever you damage a creature with your Rebuke of the Night feature, you gain temporary hitpoints equal to the damage dealt until the end of your next turn.
