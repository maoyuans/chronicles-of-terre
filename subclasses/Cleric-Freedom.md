# Cleric - Freedom Domain

Freedom is more than an ideal, it is a force, a living breathing soul that beats in the heart of every creature, powering them to break the chains cast upon them. You can feel this pulse, it calls to you and you answer. It is now your duty to give this gift of freedom to others that desire it.

## Domain Spells

At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.
- 1st: Heroism, Bless;
- 3rd: Shatter, Pass Without Trace;
- 5th: Dispel Magic, Crusader's Mantle;
- 7th: Freedom of Movement, Aura of Purity;
- 9th: Passwall, Dawn.

## Bonus Proficiency

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons. 

## Free Spirit

Whenever you or an ally within 30ft would provoke an attack of opportunity, you may use your reaction to grant +5 AC to that ally until the start of their next turn. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

## Channel Divinity: Bound No More

Starting at 2nd level, you may use your action to Channel Divinity to free the imprisoned. You and all allies within 30ft are immune to the effects of difficult terrain, have advantage on dexterity saving throws, and have +1 to AC for 1 minute. 

## Unchainable

At 6th level, you gain immunity to the effects of difficult terrain, paralysis, and being restrained. You also gain advantage on skill checks used to break a grapple. 

## Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
