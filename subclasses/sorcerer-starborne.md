# Sorcerer - Starborne

Your bloodline is derived from beings or energy from the Astral Sky. Celestials, Void Lords, or just raw exposure to aetheric energy is found in your ancestry. Starpower and void-arcana flows through your veins. 

## Astral Magic

You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class. Each of these spells counts as a sorcerer spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of sorcerer spells you know.
- 1st: Guiding Bolt, Magnify Gravity;
- 3rd: Blur, Moonbeam;
- 5th: Blink, Pulse Wave;
- 7th: Arcane Eye, Gravity Sinkhole;
- 9th: Dawn, Planar Binding.

## Startouched

At 1st level, you know the language Celestial. You learn the Eldritch Blast cantrip. It is a sorcerer spell for you, and does not count against your cantrips known. 

## Voidblood

Starting at 1st level, you have resistance to force damage. 

## Grasp of the Stars

Starting at 6th level, you can pull on your enemies' existence from the Astral Sky. As a bonus action, select an enemy. You and the enemy both have disadvantage on all attack rolls, saving throws and ability checks for 1d2 + 1 rounds. If the enemy is defeated while under this effect, you gain advantage to these rolls equal to the number of rounds you suffered the disadvantage in this way (minimum of 1 round).

Once you use this feature, you cannot use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Essential Vision

Starting at 14th level, your bloodline grants you a different perspective to see things as they truly are. You gain truesight of 60 ft. Additionally, using [Scan](../homebrew/scan) on a creature automatically grants you knowledge of its creature type, resistances, vulnerabilities, and immunities.
