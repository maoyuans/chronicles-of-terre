# Barbarian - Path of the Scarseeker

While the blinding rage of most barbarians numbs the pain from assaults on the body, some tune their senses to feel exquisite pain tenfold. This masochistic path is known as that of the Scarseeker, who fuels their rage with the wounds they receive, to tear enemies open and paint the world crimson with blood.

## Dangerous Bravado

Starting at 3rd level, while you're raging and not wearing heavy armor, you lose any resistance to slashing, piercing, or bludgeoning damage taken, and instead take 50% more damage from those damage types, rounded down.  

## Power from Pain

Starting at 3rd level, while you're raging and not wearing heavy armor, you gain a bonus to the damage rolls of melee weapon attacks equal to half of the largest amount of damage you have taken in your current rage.

## Now or Never

Starting at 6th level, you can choose one of your attacks in an attack action, and that attack has a critical range of 15-20. Using this feature provokes an opportunity attack from your target, and their attack also has a critical range of 15-20. The target can make this attack even if they do not have a reaction to use but does use their reaction if they haven't used it already. You cannot use this feature again until you finish a short rest.

## On Death's Door

Starting at 10th level, whenever you are defeated, you can instead be reduced to 1 hit point. If you use this feature, all creatures within 30 feet of you gain advantage on attack rolls for 1 round. You cannot use this feature again until you finish a long rest.

## Scarring Witness

Starting at 14th level, whenever you use the Now or Never feature, you may instead use your entire action to make the attack against all enemies within your reach. Doing so provokes an opportunity attack from each creature as a single target use of Now or Never would. If you survive this action, you are healed for half of your maximum hit points.
