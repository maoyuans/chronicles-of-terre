# Fighter - Juggernaut

As the frontline of combat, you are a fortress on the battlefield, unbreakable, unflinching, unyielding, and unrelenting.

## Hard as Steel

Starting at 3rd level, you reduce all damage you would take from any source by an amount equal to your proficiency bonus. This stacks with other damage reduction sources but is applied before resistances.  

## Reason of Fortitude

When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you learn to project your fortitude in social situations as well as the battlefield. You gain proficiency with Persuasion, and you may use your Constitution modifier for Persuasion checks instead of Charisma.

## Defensive Surge

Starting at 7th level, whenever you take the attack action with Action Surge, you can sacrifice one of the attacks you'd make. If you do, you gain advantage on all saving throws for 1 minute. This effect ends early as soon as you fail a saving throw. 

## Iron Will

Starting at 10th level, whenever you use your Indomitable class feature and succeed on the save, you gain a bonus to your next weapon damage roll equal to your character level against the source that caused you to make the saving throw.
