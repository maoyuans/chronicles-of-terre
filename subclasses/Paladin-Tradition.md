# Paladin - Oath of Tradition

The Oath of Tradition calls to those on Terre who values the arcane traditions practiced throughout centuries before the invention of firearms, alchemy, and Peran technology. Every so often, a newcomer will rise from chance and tribulation, and challenge the orders of old; Their insolence will only bring to their defeat.

The Tides of Steel brought firearms to the battlefields of Terre, and the prosperity of the [Perani Trading Corporation](../region/Peran) introduces many dazzling inventions afterwards. Paladins following the Oath of Tradition rejects them as unorthodox, heretical, disturbance to the way of life that has always been. The enforcers serving the [Provincial Empire of Okeanos](../region/Okeanos); [Labyrinthine](../region/Labyrinthine) war-priests dedicated to the deities of arcane magic; [Glorian](../region/DGE) inquisitors hunting down bandits terrorizing innocent civilians with deadly firearms; Paladins sworn to tradition preach the virtues of magic and quell the ambition of those who believe that they can disturb this established, rightful order.

## Tenets of Tradition

The tenets of Tradition vary in magnitude from paladin to paladin: Okeanosian enforcers may hunt down each and every scent of technological presence, while wandering preachers of [Zelarch](../religion/maioris/Zelarch) may tolerate those who use muskets and pistols to maintain law and order. The common ground is, however, a reverance for the practice of magic, and a disdain for the unorthodox, perhaps *unnatural*, shortcuts to prowess.

***Magic Rules Supreme.*** For many generations, mages and scholars studied the arcane torrents to master the practice of magic. Technology is merely a inferior imitation. You must show them the true power of the arcane.

***Tradition Brings Peace.*** Our kind have prospered since the dawn of time with the systems and laws of old. Those who challenge the norm challenge peace and prosperity as well.

***Respect the Past.*** Experiences and teachings of our ancestors are the building blocks of our present glory. One must show respect to our traditions and history, or be taught to do so.

## Oath Spells

You gain oath spells at the paladin levels listed.
- 3rd: Chromatic Orb, Sanctuary;
- 5th: Heat Metal, Ray of Enfeeblement;
- 9th: Blinding Smite, Elemental Weapon;
- 13th: Aura of Purity, Guardian of Faith;
- 17th: Commune, Wall of Force.

## Channel Divinity

When you take the Oath of Tradition at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.

***Wisdom of the Past.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to draw upon knowledges and teachings of past generations. As a bonus action, you grant yourself advantage on Intelligence (Arcana), Intelligence (History), and Intelligence (Religion) checks for the next 10 minutes.

***Arcane Blessing.*** You can use your Channel Divinity to imbue weapons, even mundane ones, with magic. As a bonus action, you touch a weapon to change the base damage type of attacks made with that weapon to your choice of Acid, Cold, Fire, Force, Lightning, Radiant, and Thunder, for 1 minute. If the weapon is not already magical, it becomes magical for the duration.

## Aura of Prestige

Starting at 7th level, you can bestow magical protection to allies that dominate mundane attacks without potency. You and friendly creatures within 10 ft of you have resistance to non-magical slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage, while you are not incapacitated.

When you reach 18th level in this class, the range of the aura increases to 30 ft.

## Arcane Supremacy

Starting at 15th level, you imbue your attacks and strikes with potent magic that overwhelms the enemy's defenses. Damage from your spells, Divine Smite feature, and weapons modified by your Channel Divinity: Arcane Blessing feature ignore resistances, and deals half damage through immunities.

## Champion of Unity

At 20th level, you become a beacon of magic and the prosperity it brought to society. As an action, you gain the following benefits for 1 minute:
- You become immune to non-magical slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage, and gain resistance to magical slashing, piercing, and bludgeoning damage;
- Whenever you or a friendly creature starts their turn within 30 ft of you, you may choose to grant them 15 temporary hitpoints that lasts until they finish a short or long rest;
- You can cast 1st level spells without expending a spell slot.

Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest, unless you expend a 5th-level spell slot to use it again.
