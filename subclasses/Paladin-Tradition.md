# Paladin - Oath of Tradition

The Oath of Tradition calls to those on Terre who values the arcane traditions practiced throughout centuries before the invention of firearms, alchemy, and Peran technology. Every so often, a newcomer will rise from chance and tribulation, and challenge the orders of old; Their insolence will only bring to their defeat.

The Tides of Steel brought firearms to the battlefields of Terre, and the prosperity of the [Perani Trading Corporation](../region/Peran) introduces many dazzling inventions afterwards. Paladins following the Oath of Tradition rejects them as unorthodox, heretical, disturbance to the way of life that has always been. The enforcers serving the [Provincial Empire of Okeanos](../region/Okeanos); [Labyrinthine](../region/Labyrinthine) war-priests serving the deities of arcane magic; [Glorian](../region/DGE) inquisitors hunting down bandits terrorizing innocent civilians with deadly firearms; Paladins sworn to tradition preach the virtues of magic and quell the ambition of those who believe that they can disturb this established, rightful order.

## Tenets of Tradition

The tenets of Tradition vary in magnitude from paladin to paladin: Okeanosian enforcers may hunt down each and every scent of technological presence, while wandering preachers of [Zelarch](../religion/maioris/Zelarch) may tolerate those who use muskets and pistols to maintain law and order. The common ground is, however, a reverance for the practice of magic, and a disdain for the unorthodox, perhaps *unnatural*, shortcuts to prowess.

**Magic Rules Supreme.** For many generations, mages and scholars studied the arcane torrents to master the practice of magic. Technology is merely a inferior imitation. You must show them the true power of the arcane.

**Tradition Brings Peace.** Our kind have prospered since the dawn of time with the systems and laws of old. Those who challenge the norm challenges peace and prosperity as well.

**Respect the Past.** Experiences and teachings of our ancestors are the building blocks of our present glory. One must show respect to our traditions and history, or be taught to do so.
