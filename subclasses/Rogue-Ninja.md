# Rogue - Ninja

A good assassin is not one who schemes the most, nor one whose aim is the steadiest; A good assassin is one who can strike from the most unexpected angles. A ninja is such a character, able to throw out a fan of daggers to overwhelm one or many opponents while being empty-handed a blink of the eye ago.
