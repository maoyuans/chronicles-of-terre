# Cleric - Redemption

To err is mortal, to redeem is divine. These words hold sway over the world. You may have committed a great crime or seek to show others another way. In whichever case, you summon up this power to control your own fate and the power of amends is potent. 

## Domain Spells

At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.
- 1st: Healing Word, Heroism;
- 3rd: Enhance Ability, Lesser Restoration;
- 5th: Revivify, Elemental Weapon;
- 7th: Banishment, Charm Monster;
- 9th: Wall of Light, Commune.

## Well of Giving

Your maximum hitpoints increases by 1 per cleric level. 

## Martyr of Faith

Whenever you would heal another ally with a spell, you may choose to take damage equal to the spell's level, if you do so you may heal the ally an additional amount of hit points equal to three times the damage taken. 

## Channel Divinity: Suffer For All

Starting at 2nd level, as an action you can use your Channel Divinity to endure the pain others feel. Until the start of your next turn, all allies within 30ft are resistant to all damage, but you are vulnerable to all damage. 

## Selfless Gift

Starting at 6th level, whenever you suffer damage from your Martyr of Faith feature, you may grant all other allies within 20ft a number of temporary hitpoints equal to your Wisdom modifier. These temporary hitpoints do not stack with themselves and expire after one minute.

## Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
