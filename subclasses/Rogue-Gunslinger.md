# Rogue - Gunslinger

A rapier in one hand, a pistol in another, most likely wearing a dazzlingly grandeur hat, Gunslingers are the epitome of bravery and agility. Trained in skirmish tactics, Gunslingers specialize in dancing with danger on the battlefield, agile and daring, weaving in and out of the frontline, fighting in both close-quarter and mid-range.

## Skirmish Trainings

When you take this architype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in (exotic) firearms. Additionally, firearms you wield gain the [Point-Blank](../homebrew/Firearms#Properties) property.

## Steel and Sulphur

Starting at 3rd level, when you use the attack action and attack with a finesse one-handed melee weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a light firearm you are holding. 

## Serrated Crescendo

Starting at 9th level, whenever you attack a target with a melee weapon attack, you may move 10 ft towards the target as part of the attack. Whenever you hit a target within 5 ft of you with a ranged weapon attack, you may move 10 ft away from the target as part of the attack. Both movements do not provoke attacks of opportunity.

## Duelist's Riposte

Starting at 13th level, whenever you are attacked with a melee attack, you may use your reaction to attempt to parry, granting you +2 AC. You can use this reaction after the attack is declared, but before the attack roll is revealed.

If this causes the attack to miss, you can make an attack of opportunity against the attacker with a light firearm you are holding. Sneak Attack can be applied to this attack even if its normal conditions are not satisfied.

You can use this feature a number of times equal to your dexterity modifier (minimum of once) per long rest.
