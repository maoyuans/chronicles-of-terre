# Rogue - Gunslinger

A rapier in one hand, a pistol in another, most likely wearing a dazzlingly grandeur hat, Gunslingers are the epitome of bravery and agility. Trained in skirmish tactics, Gunslingers specialize in dancing with danger on the battlefield, agile and daring, weaving in and out of the frontline, fighting in both close-quarter and mid-range.

## Skirmish Trainings

When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you gain proficiency in (exotic) firearms. Additionally, firearms you wield gain the [Point-Blank](../homebrew/Firearms#Properties) property.

## Steel and Sulphur

Starting at 3rd level, your finesse and agility allows you to weave in sidearm attacks in between quick strikes. When you use the attack action and attack with a finesse one-handed melee weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a light firearm you are holding. 

## Serrated Crescendo

Starting at 9th level, you learn to dance the lines between danger and safety on the battlefield. Whenever you attack a target with a melee weapon attack, you may move 10 ft towards the target as part of the attack. Whenever you hit a target within 5 ft of you with a ranged weapon attack, you may move 10 ft away from the target as part of the attack. Both movements do not provoke attacks of opportunity, unless you choose to.

## Duelist's Riposte

Starting at 13th level, training in skirmishes allow you to riposte incoming attacks with a deadly flourish. You gain the following features:
- Attacks of opportunity against you have disadvantage;
- Your attacks of opportunity can apply Sneak Attack even if there are no non-incapacitated allies adjacent to the target;
- When a creature attacks and misses you with an attack of opportunity, you may choose to make an attack of opportunity against the creature as a free action. You may use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus per long rest.

## Double Cross

Starting at 17th level, you follow up your combo attacks with fierce precision. After you make your first attack each turn, your attacks have advantage and ignore all damage resistances.
