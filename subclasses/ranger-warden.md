# Ranger - Arcane Warden

## Firearm Training

When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you receive training in uncenventional means to counter mages and casters. You gain proficiency in (exotic) firearms, and you may add your Dexterity modifier to your firearm's damage rolls. 

## Warden Magic

Starting at 3rd level, your connection with nature and the leylines grants you extra means to detect and punish those that abuse magic maliciously. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you, but it doesn't count against the number of ranger spells you know.
- 3rd level: Protection from Evil and Good
- 5th level: Hold Person
- 9th level: Dispel Magic
- 13th level: Counter Spell

## Snipe Cast

Starting at 3rd level, you may administer spells at long range by making a ranged attack against your target. If the attack hits, instead of dealing damage, the spell is applied on the target, ignoring range restrictions.

## Arcane Proficiency

At 7th level, you gain proficiency in Arcana. If you are already proficient in it, you gain expertise in Arcana.

## Arcane Tracing

Starting at 7th level, you can instantly identify whether a creature you can see or you are tracking is capable of spellcasting. Additionally, you may use Scan on existing effects as a free action instead of a bonus action.

## Critical Precision

Starting at 11th level, your critical range is 19 - 20, and you damage dice are tripled instead of doubled when you critically hit.
