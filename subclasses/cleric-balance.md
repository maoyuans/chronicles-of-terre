# Cleric - Balance Domain

To every action there is an opposite and equal reaction, to light there is dark, to hot there is cold, these are the natural forces that hold the world in balance. This balance is the source of your faith and belief.

## Domain Spells

At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.
- 1st: Bane, Bless;
- 3rd: Blindness/Deafness, Lesser Restoration;
- 5th: Fireball, Sleet Storm;
- 7th: Watery Sphere, Wall of Fire;
- 9th: Negative Energy Flood, Mass Cure Wounds.

## Balanced Scales

You are immune to the effects of advantage and disadvantage. Additionally, creatures cannot have advantage or disadvantage on attack rolls that target you.

## Balancing Surge

Whenever you would normally have advantage or disadvantage on an attack roll or ability check that you make, you may grant that advantage or disadvantage to another creature within 30 feet of you as a bonus action. That creature has advantage or disadvantage on the next appropriate roll they make within one minute. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier (a minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

## Channel Divinity: Wrath of Nature

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your channel divinity class feature to unleash the wrath of natural forces against those that would seek to control them. As an action, You can unleash a wave of equilibrium that affects all creatures within 30 feet. Until the start of your next turn, all enemies affected cannot gain the benefits of advantage, and all allies are immune to the effect of disadvantage.

## Balance Restored

Starting at 6th level, whenever a creature within 30 feet would fail an attack roll or saving throw with advantage or succeed on such checks with disadvantage, you are healed for a number of hit points equal to 2d10 plus your Wisdom modifier. You may instead use your reaction to grant this healing to an ally within 30 feet. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest. 

## Potent Spellcasting

Starting at 8th level, you add your Wisdom modifier to the damage you deal with any cleric cantrip.
