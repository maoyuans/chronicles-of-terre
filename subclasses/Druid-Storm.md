Wind, rain, and storm are the most primal and ferocious aspect of nature. Druids worshipping this aspect embodies the unrefined and unpredictable prowess of the storm and the sea within them.

## Master of the Storm

At 2nd level, add the following cantrips and spells to your druid spell list, and you learn one cantrip from this list.
- Cantrips: Booming Blades, Lightning Lure, Shocking Grasp
- 1st: Thunderous Smite
- 2nd: Shatter
- 3rd: Lightning Arrow, Lightning Bolt, Thunder Step
- 4th: Storm Sphere
- 6th: Chain Lightning

## Tempest's Jealousy

Starting at 2nd level, you deal 1 less damage with spells that do not deal thunder of lightning damage. You deal additional damage with spells that deal thunder or lightning damage equal to the spell's level.

## Storm's Reach

Starting at 6th level, whenever you cast a spell that deals thunder or lightning damage, you can choose another enemy within 30 feet of you that was not the damaged by the spell. That enemy is struck by a minor bolt of storm, dealing 1d6 lightning and 1d6 thunder damage to them.

- You can walk on water as if it is solid ground.
- You can breathe underwater.
