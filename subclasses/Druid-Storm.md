# Druid - Circle of the Storm

*The Circle of the Storm was remade on 07/19/2025. To view the legacy version, see [Storm (2021)](Druid-Storm-old).*

Wind, rain, and storm are the most primal and ferocious aspect of nature. Druids worshipping this aspect embodies the unrefined and unpredictable prowess of the storm and the sea within them.

## Tempest's Blessing

As a worshipper of storms, you are bestowed with control over this aspect of nature. When you reach certain levels in this class, you gain access to the following spells, and thereafter always have it prepared, and it doesn't count against the number of spells you can prepare each day. If you gain access to a spell that doesn't appear on the druid spell list, it is nonetheless a druid spell for you.
- 2nd: Fog Cloud, Thunderwave
- 3rd: Gust of Wind, Shatter
- 5th: Call Lightning, Lightning Bolt
- 7th: Ice Storm, Storm Sphere
- 9th: Control Winds, Maelstrom

## Eye of the Storm

Starting at 2nd level, you learn to gather a swirling storm around yourself that lashes out at enemies. As an action, you can expend one use of your Wild Shape feature to summon a miniature storm above you. The storm follows your movement and pours light rain down in a 10 ft radius around you, extinguishing all exposed flames and granting you resistance to fire damage, and lasts for 1 minute, until you fall unconscious, or until you dismiss it (no action required).

Additionally, while the storm is active, you can as a bonus action call down a minor bolt of lightning, dealing 1d6 lightning damage to a creature within 30 ft of you.

## Master of the Wind

Starting at 6th level, your magics are imbued with a mighty wind that knocks your enemies off their feet. Once per turn when you deal damage to a large of smaller creature with your spells or your Eye of the Storm feature, you may choose to summon a gust of wind and subject them to a Strength saving throw against your druid spellcasting DC. On a fail, the creature is pushed up to 10 ft in any direction and knocked prone.

## Vengeful Reach

Starting at 10th level, the storms you summon brew with a vengeful rage. The lightning bolts you summon with your Eye of the Storm feature improves to dealing 1d6 lightning and 1d6 thunder damage. 

Additionally, whenever a creature within 30 ft of you hits you with an attack, you may as a reaction strike them with a bolt from your Eye of the Storm feature.

## Static Maelstrom

Starting at 14th level, the storm above emanates static electricity that hinders and debilitates your foes. You gain the following benefits: 
- The range of your miniature storm and its minor bolt of lightning doubles to 20 ft and 60 ft, respectively. 
- The storm pours heavy rain around you, and counts as difficult terrain for all enemies.
- Enemies within the storm has disadvantage on all attack rolls and Strength, Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws.
