# Rogue - Gregorian

From the ivory towers of [Crestwatch](../region/DGE.md) to the deepest chambers under [the Viridian Grove](../region/Verza.md), residents of Terre, noble or peasant, all look up and pray to the higher powers watching and guiding their every move. The power of religion is a significant one, and with this significance comes those who aim to use it as a tool for themselves, not a belief.

To a Gregorian, faith is such a powerful weapon that one can fluidly shape and utilize. They may devote themselves to one deity on one day, and act as a priest for another faith the other day. Some might call Gregorians thieves of beliefs, but how are they different from those priests and cardinals anyways?

## Utilitarian Faith

When you take this architype at 3rd level, choose a Deity to serve and one of their domains to follow. You may change this Deity and domain once per level up. In addition, you can cast a 1st level spell provided by your chosen domain's spells. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for this feature. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

At 5th level, you can also cast a 2nd level spell provided by your chosen domain's spells. At 7th level, you can also cast a 3rd level spell provided by your chosen domain's spells. At 9th level, you can also cast a 4th level spell provided by your chosen domain's spells.

Spells cast by this feature can only be cast at their lowest level.

## Sectless Belief

Starting at 3rd level, you may use the channel divinity class feature of your chosen domain as a cleric of equal level to your levels in rogue. Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.

## Service to Divinity

At 9th level, you gain proficiency in Religion. If you are already proficient in Religion, you gain expertise in Religion. 

Additionally, you may change your chosen domain at the end of a long rest, as long as your chosen deity has dominion over it as well.

## Dogmatic Dillitante

At 13th level, you gain an additional use of your channel divinity class feature. Moreover, you can now use any channel divinity from any domain that your deity has dominion over.
