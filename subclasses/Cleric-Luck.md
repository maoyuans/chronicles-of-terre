# Cleric - Luck Domain

There are those between us that seems to have at life a lot easier. Things tend to go their way, be it an opportune stroke of fortune, or a timely avoidance of disaster. While this could be the outlook of the jealous and the spiteful, you understand and interpret this unnatural luck as a literal translation of divine providence, and to respect this disparity will earn you the favor of those who pull the strings.

## Domain Spells

At each indicated cleric level, you add the listed spells to your spells prepared.
- 1st: Bane, Guiding Bolt;
- 3rd: Blur, Find Traps;
- 5th: Bestow Curse, Nondetection;
- 7th: Death Ward, Mordenkainen's Faithful Hound;
- 9th: Skill Empowerment, Circle of Power.

## Bonus Proficiency

At 1st level, you gain proficiency with martial weapons. 

## Divine Luck

When you roll a 1 on an attack roll, ability check, or saving throw, you can reroll the die and must use the new roll. If you possess the Lucky Halfing Trait, you may instead use this power to reroll twice upon rolling a 1 and take either result. You may only benefit from this ability a number of times equal to your Wisdom modifier. You regain these uses when you finish a long rest. 

## Channel Divinity: Lucky Save

Starting at 2nd level, you can use your Channel Divinity to infuse an ally with luck against an effect. As a reaction when an ally you can see within 30 ft of you fails a saving throw, you can grant them +5 to the save, potentially turning it into a success.

## Improved Critical

Starting at 6th level, your weapon attacks critically hit on a 19-20.  

## Divine Strike

At 8th level, you gain the ability to infuse your weapon strikes with divine energy. Once on each of your turns when you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can cause the attack to deal an extra 1d8 damage of the same type dealt by the weapon to the target. When you reach 14th level, the extra damage increases to 2d8.
