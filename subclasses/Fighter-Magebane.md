# Fighter - Magebane

As a specialist trained in detecting and countering magic, it is your duty to seek out those who abuse this unnatural gift for ill, and make them answer for the sins they have committed.

## Countering Magic

When you take this archetype at 3rd level, you learn spells that inherently detect and counter other magics. You learn additional spells when you reach certain levels in this class. Wisdom is your casting ability for such spells. You do not have to use material components to cast them, and once you cast a countering spell you may not cast it again until you complete a long rest.
- 3rd level: Detect Magic, Silence
- 7th level: Counterspell, Dispel Magic
- 10th level: Aura of Purity, Banishment

## Magical Education

At 3rd level, you gain proficiency in Arcana.

## Resisting Will

Starting at 7th level, you gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against spells and other magical effects from creatures within 5 ft of you.

## Mana Spike

Starting at 10th level, whenever a creature within 15 ft of you casts a spell, they take 8 psychic damage from you.
