# Powered Weapons

Technological advances around Terre has led to the combination of *engines*, whether physical or magical in nature, with conventional weaponry. These weapons can be boosted with mana of all kinds, empowering their attacks with huge bursts of damage, provided that its wielder can afford to feed the fire. Most powered weapons are from the hands of magecrafters in Peran, although some engineers in Untergebirgsreich and Maltross have also mastered such crafts. While not incredibly rare, powered weapons are overall much more expensive and are not daily finds in normal blacksmith shops, and requires one to purchase from specialized merchants.

A weapon with the powered property allows its wielder to supercharge its attacks with magical energies, using spell slots unless otherwise specified. Powering the weapon takes a bonus action, or as part of the attack if the wielder is expending his own spell slots, stated before the attack roll is made. A powered attack deals additional damage as specified in the parentheses, and expends the powering up once used, regardless of hit or miss. Any additional properties of powered attacks, or effects of using higher level spell slots, are specified in weapon description.

As examples of powered weapons you may find in Chronicles of Terre:
> **Jet Maul**
> *Weapon (Maul), powered (2d6).*
> A maul with built-in jet boosters. When powered up, the boosters thrust the maul with your swing, giving the powered attack +2 to attack rolls.

> **Weakpoint Rifle**
> *Weapon (Musket), powered (2d6).*
> This musket is augmented with charged chambers that specializes in breaking through weakpoints in enemy defense. Powered attacks have a base critical threshold of 19.
