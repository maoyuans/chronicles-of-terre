# Feats

Note that due to using a modified version of firearms, the Gunner feat in TCE is not available.

## Antagonizer

You are talented at antagonizing others, provoking them to focus their attention on you. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Wis or Cha score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- As a bonus action, you can antagonize and distract a creature within 30 ft that can see or hear you, and force them to make a Wis save. The DC for this save is equal to 8 + Prof + the modifier for the ability increased by this feat. On a fail, until the end of its next turn, the creature has disadvantage on all attacks against targets other than you. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your proficiency modifier per long rest.

## Bastion

You stand guard on the battlefield between your friends and your foes, shielding those behind you from attacks. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Str or Con score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- When a creature within 5 ft of you makes an attack against a target other than you, or when a creature makes an attack against a target within 5 ft of you, you can use your reaction to become the target of this attack instead.

## Familial Tactician

*Prerequisite: Access to a familiar*

You specialize your familiar in reconnoitre and analysis, allowing it to evasively survey the battlefield and your enemies. You gain the following benefits:
- You can temporarily dismiss your familiar into a pocket dimension as a reaction instead of an action.
- Your familiar can use their action to Scan.

## Firearm Specialist

You are trained in the usage of firearms, with proficiency comparable to that of a skilled hunter with bows and arrows. You gain the following benefits:
- Increase your Dex score by 1, to a maximum of 20.
- You gain proficiency with (exotic) firearms.
- You can add your ability score bonus to damages with firearms.

## Iron Reflexes

Your reflexes are honed to catch the lapse of concentration in your enemies. You gain the following benefits:
- You gain an additional reaction that you can use every round. This reaction can only be used to make an opportunity attack.
- Whenever you take the Dash action, you can spend a reaction to make an opportunity attack with a melee weapon.

## Magecrafting Initiate

*Qualifies as an Origin Feat for 24' rules.*

You have taken interest in the technological advances of [Peran](../region/Peran), and learned a few magecrafting techniques to utilize in and out of the battlefield. 

You learn two Artificer Infusions of your choice from the artificer class. You may only infuse one item with one of the infusions at a time. All other rules of artificer infusions apply.

If an infusion has a level requirement, you can only choose that infusion if your levels in Artificer meet the requirement. *(That means not for now, sorry.)* Whenever you reach a level that grants an ASI, you can replace one of these Infusion options with another one.

## Poisoner

*Under construction*

## Potent Healer

*Prerequisite: Spellcasting*

You are particularly talented in healing magic, rendering your spells more potent than that of others. You gain the following benefits:
- You gain proficiency in the Medicine skill.
- Whenever you use a spell of 1st level or higher that restores hitpoints to a creature, it regains additional hitpoints equal to 2 + your proficiency bonus. This feature is only applied once per source, once per target.
- Whenever you heal a creature in excess of that creature's maximum hitpoints, it gains temporary hitpoints equal to the excess amount.

## Quickshooter

You take preference in lightweight firearms and can weave in quick shots between actions. You gain the following benefits:
- When you use the Attack action and attack with a one-handed weapon, you can use a bonus action to attack with a light firearm you are holding.
- Once per turn, you can draw one weapon as a free action instead of an item interaction.

## Sharpshooter (Variant)

*This variant replaces the original version of Sharpshooter.*

You have mastered ranged weapons and can make shots that easily find weakspots on the enemy. You gain the following benefits:
- Attacking at long range doesn't impose disadvantage on your ranged weapon attack rolls.
- Your ranged weapon attacks ignore half cover and three-quarters cover.
- Your ranged weapon attacks with advantage have -1 to critical range.

## Shield Breaker

Your skill in the martial arts has focused on overwhelming the heavy armor of your foes. You gain the following benefits:
- As a bonus action, you can enhance one of the melee weapon attacks you are about to make this turn. If the enchanced attack hits, the target has their AC lowered by 2 until the end of your next turn. Subsequent hits enhanced by this feat refreshes the duration instead of lowering the AC.
- When you score a critical hit to a creature wielding a Shield, you can remove their shield's bonus to AC temporarily until the end of your next turn.
