# Character Creation

This page lists all character creation options that differs from the official 5th edition ruleset.

## Choose a Race

Most races from official sources are available, with a few exceptions. Consult [Demography](../demography) for more information and your DM for approval.

## Choose a Class

With the exception of artificers, all official classes are available.

With the exception of School of Chronurgy Wizards, all official subclasses are available.

There are a variety of curated homebrew subclasses available for selection. Consult [Subclasses](../subclasses/subclasses) for a comprehensive list.

## Ability Scores

Using the standard array (15/14/13/12/10/8) is strongly recommended.

## Origin as Background

Chronicles of Terre uses an alternative to the background option in 5th edition to allow more room to customize your character. A character's origin signifies their cultural and occupational background prior to their adventures. Mechanically, an origin usually provides a single ability score increase, two proficiencies, and a minor feature.

A list of options and instructions are available at [Origins](origins).

## Languages

All characters can choose to learn an extra language of their choice. This is to compensate the lack of languages provided by backgrounds.

In Chronicles of Terre, Infernal Common exists in place of both Common and Infernal, as the tiefling Forgotten Empire is the first civilization to exert a major influence on Terre. Races that starts with Infernal (such as tieflings) can choose to learn Abyssal instead.

## Starting Equipment

Other than their standard starting equipments, characters are encouraged to bring a few trinkets and baubles with them. Characters with religious beliefs often bring trinkets bearing their deity's holy symbol.

Such trinkets should not provide any mechanical benefit or have major monetary value, but can bring roleplay opportunities.

## Starting ASI

Characters gain an additional ASI at 1st level. Note that ASIs in Chronicles of Terre uses a variant rule as described in the section below.

## Hitpoints Increase

In Chronicles of Terre, hitpoints gained when leveling up are calculated by rolling the hit dice, with the average as the minimum. Roll untill you hit a value at least the average.

## Ability Score Improvements

In Chronicles of Terre, ASIs consist of improving one ability score by 1, and selecting a feat. This also applies to the additional ASI at 1st level.

A list of curated homebrew feats are available at [Feats](feats).

## Character Backstories

Players are strongly encouraged to discuss with the DM to formulate a backstory for their character that can be incorporated into the setting.

## Starting Rumors

Players are encouraged to write a few rumors, truth, exaggeration, or fiction, to provide to their party members and potentially NPCs. A reasonable suggestion is two truths, two exaggerations, and one fiction.
