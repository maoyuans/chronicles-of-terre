# Origins

Chronicles of Terre uses an alternative to the background option in 5th edition to allow more room to customize your character. A character's origin signifies their cultural and occupational background prior to their adventures. Mechanically, an origin usually provides a single ability score increase, two proficiencies, and a minor feature.

To select an origin, consult the list below, and choose a region and a sub-origin. Your cultural background should correspond to the region, and your occupational background should be somewhat reflected by your choice of sub-origin. It is suggested to choose a sub-origin under your chosen region, but exceptions can be made in accordance to your character's backstory.

Any combination of class and race can take any origin, but certain origins are only reasonably taken by certain combinations. For example, a Grove Keeper or Gate Warden of [Verza](../region/verza) are seldomly netheric arcane casters, and non-tieflings in [Okeanos](../region/okeanos) are almost always Foreign Subjects. Discuss with your DM to come up with a reasonable selection of origin.
