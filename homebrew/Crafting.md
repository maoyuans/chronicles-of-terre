# Crafting

Chronicles of Terre has its own **optional**, **experimental** crafting system. In short, campaigns can choose to opt into scavenging crafting materials instead of coins and other currency objects, and can either choose to trade the materials for currency, or to craft items, mundane or magic, from these materials following a certain recipe.

*I'm still not so sure about this so this whole thing is very very very subject to changes.*

## Crafting Materials

By opting into the crafting system, monsters and treasures will sometimes yield materials instead of coins and currency objects. These materials will be characterized by the following entries: name, quality, tag, type:
- Name: What the material really is. This is an arbitrarily assigned name that (usually) does not have a mechanical effect.
- Quality: The quality of the material, corresponding to the level of play this material is expected to be for. This corresponds to rarities assigned to magic items.
- Tag: What special traits does this material possess. There are 20 universal tags, while some special material might possess special tags. For example, the blood or bone of a demon might have the *fiendish* tag, and star dust left behind by a meteor might have the *radiant* or even *dimensional* tags.
- Type: What type of material this one is. This describes the most fundamental property of a material, what it is. Mythril is a kind of *mineral* that can be smelt into bars of *metal*; killing a dire wolf can yield dire wolf *bone* or dire wolf *hide*.

The value of a material depends on primarily its quality, secondarily its tags, and possibly all other factors.

## Crafting Recipes

Each mundane or magic item can be crafted with between 3 to 8 materials, depending on the type of the item. A recipe describes the set of properties these materials must collectively satisfy.
